<h2>Chuck Martin's Portfolio Page</h2>
      <p>From this page you can view several disparate examples of documentation 
        I've designed and developed, some other work that I've done, and my resume.</p>
      <h3>Writing Samples</h3>
      <p><a href="tight_writing.html">Tight Writing</a><br>
        A page containing samples of content I've edited, rewritten, or otherwise made better.
      </p>
<p><a href="PDF/Nokia_Horizon_Line_Data_Clouds_User_Guide.pdf">Horizon Line User &amp; Maintenance Guide</a> <span class="pdf">(1.6 MB PDF file)</span><br>
First is a document prepared for a contract client who designed and built a permanently installed data visualization system. They wanted a document that would allow the customer to do basic maintenance and troubleshooting without the need to call support. In the pre-hire interview, I asked a number of questions about how the devices worked and how the customer would use them, which led to the company's engineers automating some functions, making the system simpler and leading to a shorter document.</p>
<p><a href="uitextsamples.html">QuickBooks UI content</a><br>
One of my responsibilities at Intuit was content within the applicaiton UI, the first level of user assistance. On two different teams, Online Banking and Forms Customization, I wrote the content for two wizards.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:openRivioWin();">Rivio Help Sample</a><br>
  This is a substantial section of an HTML-based help file for a web application. 
        I've extracted the sections I designed, organized, and wrote. The original 
        ran within a proprietary XML framework; I've extracted the content and 
        duplicated the organization with DevaHelp, a Dreamweaver extension that was developed by online help expert Ben Weisner.</p>
<p><a href="/portfolio/PDF/Setup_and_Configuration_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Rivio 
  Setup and Configuration Guide</a> <span class="pdf">(210 KB PDF file)</span><br>
  This  is a PDF file of an administration guide for the Rivio software..</p>
      <p><a href="/portfolio/PDF/eVox%20Web%20User%20Guide.pdf" target="_blank">eVox 
  Web User Guide</a> <span class="pdf">(771 KB PDF file)</span><br>
  <a href="/portfolio/PDF/eVox%20Rater%20Guide.pdf" target="_blank">eVox 
  Rater Guide</a> <span class="pdf">(185 KB PDF file)</span><br>
  These two samples are for users of an internal system. One is a user 
        guide for a web application; the other is instructions for using a phone-based 
        application, and it was designed to be printed double-sided on 8.5&quot; x 
        11&quot; paper (two sheets), then folded to make a 5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot; 
  booklet.</p>
<p><a href=javascript:callPIVHelp('Project_InVision_User_Guide.htm');>Project InVision Help</a><br>
  This sample is an HTML-based help system for a web application. It was 
        developed in RoboHTML. The content was almost entirely rewritten and reorganized 
        to make it task-based. The keyword index is completely new. And I designed a
&quot;skin&quot; to match the look and feel of the application itself. (Note: the browser-sniffing code RoboHelp used to generate JavaScript-based navigation back on the early 2000s causes the navigation pane to not display in Google Chrome for Windows.)</p>
      <p><a href="Timogen/TACUserGuide.pdf" target="_blank">Timogen Adaptive Controller User Guide</a> <span class="pdf">(2.3 MB PDF file)</span><br>
      <a href="javascript:openTimogenWin();">Timogen Adaptive Controller Help</a><br>
      This sample contains both a PDF version and an online Help version of documentation I wrote for Timogen Systems. As a contractor, I was not involved early with the development team and came on-board when the project was nearing release. Thus, I was unable to do a lot of planning and estimating, but rather had to dive in, learn about the product specifics, and start writing. I quickly defined the area I needed to document and tracked my progress in each area. I single-sourced content in Adobe FrameMaker and used Quadralay WebWorks Publisher to create the online help, making some changes to the template files to create the Timogen-specific look-and-feel.</p>
<p><a href="Java_Primer_for_Help_Authors.htm">Java Primer for Help Authors</a><br>
In the late 90s, I took a Java Programming class. A couple of companies had created Java-based help systems. I gave a presentation at the 1999 WritersUA Conference for Software User Assistance on Java programming and the new help technologies.</p>
<h3>WritersUA Newsletters</h3>
      <p>I've attended every <a href="http://www.writersua.com/ohc/index.html" title="WritersUA Conference for Software User Assiatance">WritersUA Conference for Software User Assistance</a>. And for more than a dozen years, I've produced a daily conference newsletters. Here are some samples of those, all in PDF format.</p>

<h3>Resume</h3>

      <p>You can also download and view an<a href="Chuck Martin Resume.epub"> ePub version</a>, viewable in most eReaders (except Kindle). To view this version in iBooks, download the file, import it into iTunes, then synchronize it with your &quot;i&quot; device (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch) with the iBooks app installed.</p>
