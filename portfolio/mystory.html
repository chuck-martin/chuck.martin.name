<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>I am a content developer (technical writer) with a degree in  Technical Communication and with tons of experience in and passion for content  experience, technology, and usability.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve loved writing ever since high  school. Not only did I excel in my English classes, I wrote for the local  newspaper. I was a computer geek way back then too, writing code on a Radio  Shack TRS-80 Model II that our electronics shop borrowed during my senior year.  (My teachers had to kick me out of shop at the end of the day so they could go  home.)</p>
<p>  I&rsquo;m a science nerd too. I once was  going to get degrees in meteorology and astronomy, but in my studies toward  that goal, I found technical communication and never looked back.</p>
<p> The latter I found was my greatest  passion. Creating great content experiences helps people succeed at what they  do, whether those content experiences are through printed manuals, online help,  tutorials, error messages, release notes, tooltips, or UI text.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve developed content for just  about everyone: end users, administrators, developers, business operations, and  many more user types, all the while making that content clear, consistent,  concise, correct, and most of all, findable and usable. And I&rsquo;ve done it with  all sort of tools, from powerful and robust help authoring tools (HATs) to  plain old text editors. </p>
<p> Almost since I began in this  industry, I&rsquo;ve shared with others. From almost the day I began working after  graduation, I was involved on the TECWR-L list listening, learning, and sharing  what I&rsquo;d learned. I presented at the WritersUA conference a few times. More  recently, I&rsquo;ve been active in industry LinkedIn groups, and some of my <a href="https://medium.com/@chuck_martin">Medium</a> essays are about technical  writing, software development, user experience, and tech in general.</p>
<p> I get great pleasure in applying  technical communication principles to my work. It is delightful when I discover  content I can reuse and successfully make it happen. I think in content  patterns and I&rsquo;m solving content problems in the shower, behind the wheel, and  while I&rsquo;m falling sleep. I read writing and tech books for fun.</p>
<p> That&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t have a  life. I&rsquo;m a sports fan and wear my loyalties on my sleeve. I&rsquo;m active in many sports, including softball,  basketball, soccer, and football. I&rsquo;m involved in my community, volunteering  with a variety of organizations over the years. More recently, I&rsquo;ve worked with  Habitat for Humanity, including many days on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SorkelRS7Cs">7555 Mission</a> project in  Daly City.</p>
<p> When I&rsquo;m creating great content  experiences, I look forward to waking up and going to the office each and every  day. Doing the work that I love has given me the opportunity to meet many great  people, develop great products, and learn so many new things. My journey is not  complete, and my next adventure is ready to begin.</p>
