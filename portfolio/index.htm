          <td>I recently attended a UX Writers meetup event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-UX-Writers-Meetup/events/258309919/">UX Writers & UX Designers Unite: A Mini Hackathon</a>. For the mini hackathon, we divided into teams. In one hour, we were to come up with the designs and UI text for a caregiver app. Specifically, we were tasked with designing the login and basic information entry screens. My team took first place, and one of the things the judges mentioned in their summary was the app's comfortable, conversational text, which is what I drove in our group. This PDF is what we designed.</td>

          <td><p>This is the help system I worked on for more than 3 years to support Service Design Center, a SaaS application for cellular companies to manage their network, their product catalog, and their customers. It is all original content. I began developing the content in Atlassian Confluence, but Confluence turned out to be a poor choice for a Help Authoring Tool (HAT). I researched SaaS-based tools and chose HelpIQ, which was sold during the time I was developing content for ItsOn and was rebranded as ProProfs Knowledgebase.</p>
          <p>I exported the entirety of the help system and have been re-creating it in Adobe RoboHelp. The current sample is a partial one, being hosted on GitHub, and will grow over time until it is complete. What is there demonstrates my writing style and how I organize the content for this application. Note that some links, primarily ones to topics that have yet to be added to this sample, do not yet work. Also, there is a bug in RoboHelp that does not automatically open books that contain topics on the first click, but you can view the topic associated with the book by clicking the book a second time. </p></td>

          <td>This is a document prepared for a contract client who designed and built a permanently installed data visualization system. They wanted a document that would allow the customer to do basic maintenance and troubleshooting without the need to call support. In the pre-hire interview, I asked a number of questions about how the devices worked and how the customer would use them. My questioning led to the company's engineers to automate some functions and make the system simpler. This also resulted in a shorter, simpler document.<br>
          <br>
          This illustrates the common fallacy that a technical writer needs to be a domain expert to be successful. I knew nothing about the specific technology going in, yet my background in and knowledge of technology allowed me to first ask intelligent questions when I was in the interview stage and then learn about the specific technology and its users during the documentation development process.</td>

&quot;skin&quot; to match the look and feel of the application itself. (Note: the browser-sniffing code RoboHelp used to generate JavaScript-based navigation back on the early 2000s causes the navigation pane to not display in Google Chrome for Windows.)</td>

As a contractor, I was not involved early with the development team and came on-board when the project was nearing release. Thus, I was unable to do a lot of planning and estimating, but rather had to dive in, learn about the product specifics, and start writing. I quickly defined the area I needed to document and tracked my progress in each area. I single-sourced content in Adobe FrameMaker and used Quadralay WebWorks Publisher to create the online help, making some changes to the template files to create the Timogen-specific look-and-feel.</td>

<h3>WritersUA Newsletters</h3>
      <p>I attended nearly every <a href="http://www.writersua.com/ohc/index.html" title="WritersUA Conference for Software User Assiatance">WritersUA Conference for Software User Assistance</a>.
