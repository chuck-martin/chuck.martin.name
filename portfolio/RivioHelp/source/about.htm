<div class="topictitle">About This Help Sample</div>
<p>The Help sample is a subset of the Help system I developed and maintained while I was at Rivio. It is the online Help component of the Rivio suite of small business applications, including Payroll Manager Online, Office Manager with Payroll, and Office Manager.</p>
<p>Some of the content in the whole Help system was authored by others. That content is not included in this sample. In addition, that Help system was designed and coded to run withing that web application's framework. To present this sample, I had to remove some of the JavaScript programming that made it work in that framework, and then create a new navigation system. That navigation, a JavaScript table of contents, preserves as much as possible the original.</p>
<p>This sample demonstrates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing style</li>
  <li>Organization</li>
  <li>User focus</li>
</ul>
