Using Excel to Create a CSV file
</h1>-->

<p>Many spreadsheet programs can import CSV files.  Specifically, the sample CSV file is designed for Microsoft Excel or a similar spreadsheet program. </p>

<p>The sample contains a column-header row that briefly identifies the fields and simple instructions.</p>

<h2>To create a CSV file using Excel</h2>
<ol>
<li>Once the sample file is saved on your local hard disk, start Excel or your preferred spreadsheet program and open the file.</li>

<li>The CSV file does not have formatting information such as column widths, so make adjustments to easily read the data.</li>

<li>Enter (or cut-and-paste from another application) your employee data, following the samples and the column names.  While you are preparing the file, you can save it in the spreadsheet program&#39;s native format.</li>

<li>When you have entered all your employee data, delete the instructions.</li>

<li>Save the file as a CSV file.  You can now use the Data Import system to select and import this file.</li>

</ol>
