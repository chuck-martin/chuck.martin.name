<div class="topictitle">About Policies and Procedures</div>

<p>The Company Policies area is where you publish your organization&#39;s policies and procedures. Policies might include your standards for items such as Expense Report Reimbursements, Benefits, or Travel. Procedures give employees details on your organization&#39;s procedures, such as Security and Locking Up, What to do in Emergencies, or How to Contact Building Maintenance.</p>

<p>Any employee with access to the system can view policies. However, you must have Administrator access rights to create or modify the policies.</p>
