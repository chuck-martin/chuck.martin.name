<div class="topictitle">Earning Types Detail</div>
<p>On the Earning Setup page, you define the different ways that employees earn their pay. If you are already using a payroll provider, use this page to duplicate the type of information you already use with your current provider (This will assist when creating the payroll report you fax to your current provider).</p>
<p>The table below will help you enter the correct information on this page.</p>
<table>
  <thead> 
  <tr valign="top">
  <th width="130">Column</th>
  <th>Description</th></tr>
  </thead> 
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><b>Name</b></td>
    <td>This is a short text description or abbreviation of the different types of earnings available. You can enter up to 7 characters. You might want to use abbreviations of REG for regular hours, OT for overtime hours, PTO for paid time off, and so on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
    <td>You can enter a longer description of up to 20 characters here.

    <td><b>Is this based upon hours worked?</b></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Select&nbsp;<b>Yes</b> if the earning code is for an hourly wage calculation. Typically, you would also select Nonexempt when you select Hours.</li>
        <li>Select&nbsp;<b>No</b> if the earning code is for payments usually based on fixed dollar amounts (that do not need to be calculated), such as bonuses. The fixed amount may be based on a unit of time (week, month, etc.), or an agreed-upon amount of work. Typically, you would also select Exempt when you select Dollars.</li>
      </ul>

  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><b>Who is this earning applicable to?</b></td>
    <td> 
      <p>In general, there are two types of employees: exempt and nonexempt. Typically, exempt employees are salaried employees who receive a set amount of pay every time period and do not receive overtime. Nonexempt employees are typically paid a set amount for each hour they work and are eligible for overtime. (The amount of time an employee works before receiving overtime is typically defined by law on a state-to-state basis.)</p>
      <p>When creating a payroll, there is a time sheet allocation page. Exempt and nonexempt employees are separated by these categories on this page.</p>
