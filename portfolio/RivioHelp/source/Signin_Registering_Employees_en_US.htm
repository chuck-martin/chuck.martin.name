<!--<h1>
Registering Employees 
</h1>-->
<p>For security, the System Administrator controls when any employee is allowed access to the system.  You can do this at any time after you have registered your company.  To give an employee access to the system, you must create an Employee record that includes this minimum information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Name</li>
  <li>Last Name</li>
  <li>Work E-mail Address</li>
</ul>

<p>You may want to enter other employee information at the same time as you enter this, but the above is the minimum required.</p>

<p>If you already have a database of employee information, in a spreadsheet, a database, or in QuickBooks, you can create employee records by importing that data into the system.  You can import employee data at any time after you have completed your registration. </p>

<p>The import process is completely compatible with QuickBooks 99 and QuickBooks 2000.  For other data, you simply prepare a spreadsheet with your data in columns in the appropriate order, save it, and enter that filename on the Import page.</p>
