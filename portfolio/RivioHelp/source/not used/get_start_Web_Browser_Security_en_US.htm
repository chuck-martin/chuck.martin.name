<h2>Browser Security Alerts</h2>

<p>Web browsers display Security Alerts to notify you about
certain situations regarding your computer's security. Because this site uses SSL
technology to keep your personal and financial profile secure, you might
encounter browser Security Alerts while using the applications. The two most
common alerts you might encounter deal with:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="#secure">Secure connections (SSL)</a></li>
 <li><a href="#cookie">Cookies</a></li>
</ul>



<p>While using the site, it is normal to enter and leave secure
connections or for cookies to be written to your computer, and you should
choose to continue when you encounter these alerts. However, you can also
choose to hide these Security Alerts to reduce or eliminate any inconvenience
they might cause you. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="#turnoff">How to turn off Security
Alerts</a> below. </p>



<a name="secure"></a><h2>SSL — Secure Connections  </h2>

<p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the industry standard in Web
security. It is used primarily for transmitting sensitive information over the
Internet. When you have a secure connection between your browser and a Web
site, no one else can easily access the data that you send across the
connection. This site uses SSL to encrypt the personal and financial data you
transmit to us. </p>



<p>Occasionally, your browser might display a security alert to
notify you that you are entering or leaving a secure connection. These alerts
serve to tell you when the system is taking precautions to keep the information
you supply (such as Social Security Number or your payroll information) secure
while it travels from your computer to the site server or vice versa. This is
normal, and you can choose to continue in both cases. </p>



<p>You can choose not to have your browser display these
security alerts. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="#turnoff">How to turn off Security Alerts</a>
below. </p>



<a name="cookie"></a><h2>What is a cookie and how safe is it? 
</h2>

<p>A cookie is a very small text file that a Web site can save
to your computer's hard disk to store information about the site. We do not use
cookies to store your profile, your password, address, or any financial
information. However, we do use cookies to store the intermediate
&quot;state&quot; of the application to provide a richer, more responsive
experience to you as a user. </p>



<p>A cookie cannot be run like a program, nor can it deliver
viruses. The cookies we place are uniquely yours, and can only be read by the
Web site that saved it to your computer. </p>



<p>Occasionally, your browser might display a Security Alert to
notify you that a participating partner site is trying to write a cookie to
your computer. This is normal, and you should accept the cookie.. For more
information about our use of cookies, please review the Privacy Policy
for this site.</p>
