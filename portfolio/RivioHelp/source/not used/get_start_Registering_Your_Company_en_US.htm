<p>If you are using Rivio Payroll Manager or Rivio Payroll Manager Office Edition, your company setup will be performed by InterPay, your integrated payroll provider. If you are using Rivio Office Manager, the steps below describe the company registration process.</p>
<p>Company registration involves these four steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select Product and Plan</li>
  <li>Register Company</li>
  <li>Register Administrator</li>
  <li>Accept Terms of Service</li>
</ol>
<p>As you complete each page in the registration process, click&nbsp;<b>Next</b> to proceed to the next step. Fields with a red asterisk (<span class="alert">*</span>) are required fields. If you do not complete these fields, you will receive an error message when you try to proceed to the next page.</p>

<h2>Before You Begin</h2>

<p>To complete the company registration process, you will need the following information:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Company name </li>
 <li>Company address </li>
 <li>Company ID (Choose an ID between 3 and 16 characters, starting with a letter. Do not use spaces.) </li>
 <li>Credit card information </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Choose Product and Plan</h2>

<p>Choose a product and plan from the available options.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Register Company</h2>

<p>Enter your company information here, and set the Company ID that you and your employees will use to access your company's data on the site. You and your employees must enter the&nbsp;<b>Company ID</b> on the Sign-In
page when you attempt to sign in.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Register Administrator</h2>

<p>Administrator
Registration allows you to register yourself as the System Administrator for the site. When you complete the Administrator Registration step, you will receive a welcome e-mail message verifying your company registration. You can assign more than one administrator, or change administrators for the site at any time after completing this initial registration by changing any employee's access rights from employee to administrator.</p>

<p>When you have completed the Administrator Registration step, be sure to read the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Security Statement. You must click&nbsp;<b>Accept</b> at the end of the Terms of Service to be able to use the system.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Accept Terms of Service</h2>

<p>When you have accepted the Terms of Service, your registration is complete.</p>
