<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_26">
How safe is my information within Rivio?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>Rivio has taken great care to ensure that the data stored in the Rivio database is protected. Not only is the Rivio server site physically protected, but your password is stored in an encrypted form. For anyone to access information you have entered in the Rivio system, they must have a valid sign in ID and password (which, with respect to any employee&#39;s data, includes those with administrative privileges). Additionally, when Rivio transmits any of your data to a third party service, it is transmitted in SSL encrypted format. For more information about Rivio&#39;s security efforts, read our&nbsp;<a href="javascript:DisplayCSCWindow('/ebopsweb/appasp/legal/security_statement.htm')">Security Statement</a>.</p></div>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_27">
How does Rivio manage company rights to information and employee privacy?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>Rivio has built controlled access into the product so that each business&#39; owner/manager can define the access for each employee to prevent employees from viewing restricted information. A complete description of our privacy-related practices is available in our&nbsp;<a href="javascript:DisplayCSCWindow('/ebopsweb/appasp/legal/privacy_policy.htm')">Privacy Policy</a>.</p></div>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_28">
Why do I get a Security Alert dialog box when I access certain tabs on the site?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>Depending on your browser settings, this dialog box appears when you access pages that are not SSL-enabled. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the secure connection technology used primarily for transmitting sensitive information over the Internet. It is the industry standard in Web security. This site uses SSL to encrypt the personal and financial data you transmit to us. However, pages that do not involve the transmission of personal or financial data are not SSL-enabled. For example, you might see a Security Alert dialog box when you access the Goods &amp; Services or Resources tabs. These pages do not involve transmission of confidential data. When the dialog box appears you can choose to continue by clicking Yes. For more information, please review the Privacy Policy and the Security Statement for this site.</p></div>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_29">
Are Rivio&#39s services available only to U.S. Companies?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>Rivio&#39;s platform is intended for use only by United States companies and their United States-based employees.</p></div>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_30">
I&#39m an America Online Member. Will your service still work for my needs?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>The Rivio Quality Assurance Department has certified the Rivio system with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x and newer, and Netscape Navigator 6.1 and newer browsers. Most other browsers that support Dynamic HTML should work well. However, add-on &quot;Internet Accelerators&quot; that cache or pre-cache Internet pages may present some problems. The Rivio QA Department has not tested these products, nor has it tested the product with AOL, which also performs caching.</p></div>
