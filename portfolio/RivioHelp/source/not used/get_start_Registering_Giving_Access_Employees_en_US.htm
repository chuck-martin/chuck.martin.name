<div class="topictitle">Registering and Giving Access to Employees</div>

<p>To maintain security, giving system access to employees is separate from entering employee information (making a new employee record). A new employee record must have a minimum amount of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First Name </li>
  <li>Last Name </li>
  <li>Work E-mail Address </li>
</ul>

<p>You may want to enter other employee information at the same time as you enter this, but the above is the minimum required.</p>

<p>If you already have a database of employee information, in a spreadsheet, a database, or in QuickBooks, you can create employee records by importing that data into the system. You can import employee data at any time after you have completed your registration.</p>

<p>The import process is completely compatible with QuickBooks 99 and QuickBooks 2000. For
other data, you simply prepare a spreadsheet with your data in columns in the appropriate order, save it, and enter that filename on the Import page.</p>

<p>After you enter or import your employee information, you can provide access to the system for those employees. Several levels of access are available, but most are for specific administrative tasks. You&#39;ll want to give most employees&nbsp;<b>Employee</b> access rights.</p>

<h2>To create a new employee record from System Setup</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Set Up Human Resources</b>. You see the Human Resources Setup page.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Enter Data Manually</b> You see a blank Add Employee form.</li>
</ol>
<h2>To create a new employee record from anywhere in the system</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click the&nbsp;<b>My Company </b>tab.</li>
  <li>Open the&nbsp;<b>Employee Records</b> section of the menu.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Employee Info</b>. You see the Employee Records List. Your name will be on the list.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Add Employee</b>. You see a blank Add Employee form.</li>
</ol>

<h2>To create a minimal Employee Record</h2>
<ol>
  <li>On the&nbsp;<b>Add Employee</b> form,&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> tab, enter the employee&#39;s first and last names.</li>
  <li>Click the&nbsp;<b>Work</b> tab.</li>
  <li>Select the employee&#39;s Work Address from the drop-down list. This list contains the address you used when you registered, and any other company addresses you have entered using&nbsp;<b>Company Info</b> &gt;&nbsp;<b>Locations</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter the employee&#39;s&nbsp;<b>Work E-mail Address</b>.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Save</b>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>To grant an employee access to the system</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click the&nbsp;<b>My Company </b>tab.</li>
  <li>Open the&nbsp;<b>System Admin</b> section of the menu.</li>
  <li>Click the&nbsp;<b>Access Rights</b> menu item. You see the Access Rights page, open on the No Access list.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Assign Access</b>. You see a list of employees that currently have no access.</li>
  <li>Click an employee name.</li>
  <li>Select a level of access rights.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Create Account(s)</b>. You now see the Access list, where the employee&#39;s name has been added.</li>
</ol>

<p>The employee now has a User ID that has been automatically generated by the system. Before you notify the employee of their new access rights, you may want to change that
User ID.</p>

<h2>To change an employee&#39;s User ID</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In the Access list, click on the employee&#39;s name. You see the Access Rights page for that employee.</li>
  <li>Enter a new User ID for the employee.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Save</b>. You return to the Access list.</li>
</ol>

<h2>To notify employees that they have access to the system</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select the employees you want to notify. Make sure that the User IDs are appropriate.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Notify Selected Employee(s)</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>E-mail notices are automatically sent that inform the employees of the Web site address, the Company ID, their User ID, and a random password. They will be asked to change their password when they first sign in.</p>
