<p>To integrate your payroll information with the payroll vendor InterPay, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure all&nbsp;<a href="HREmpRecords_Add_Employee_en_US.htm">employees are entered</a>&nbsp;into your company information.</li>
  <li><a href="payroll_About_Setup_en_US.htm">Complete the payroll setup</a>&nbsp;data, items such as selecting payroll frequencies, earning codes, and deduction items you company uses.</li>
  <li>Complete all employee payroll data entry, items such as salary, deductions, and withholding settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: The initial setup page also contains a link to a document listing what documents and information you&#39;ll need.</p>
<p>You may also print preview the information that will be sent by clicking the&nbsp;<b>Print Preview</b> button.</p>
<p>An account representative will then contact you to collect more information and complete the integration process.</p>
<h2>For a new business, you will need to provide:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Copy of voided check from bank account in which payroll checks will be drawn</li>
  <li>Federal and State Identification Numbers or copies of your completed applications</li>
</ul>
<h2>For an existing business, you will need to provide:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Copy of voided check from bank account in which payroll checks will be drawn</li>
  <li>Federal and State Identification Numbers or copies of your completed applications</li>
  <li>Copy of each payroll processed in the current quarter</li>
  <li>Prior quarter(s) tax returns</li>
  <li>Payroll tax liabilities and payments made in current quarter</li>
  <li>Employee year to date and quarter to date totals (including gross, federal tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, state tax, local/disability tax and any voluntary deductions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your conversion is complete (usually takes 7-11 days), your account will be activated. This means that you will be able to submit your payroll data online to InterPay for pay period processing. This submission button is located at the end of the payroll processing workflow. For each pay period you submit online for processing, the calculated results will be presented back to you for your final approval prior to checks and direct deposits being sent to you and your employees. </p>
