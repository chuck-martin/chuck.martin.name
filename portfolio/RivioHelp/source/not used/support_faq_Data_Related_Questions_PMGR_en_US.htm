When I enter a date (such as a birth date), the system converts the format. What date formats can I use?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>The system displays dates in the format "mm/dd/yyyy". The system converts the date you enter to its display format. If the system cannot recognize the date, it does not save the data. You will see a data validation error message and be prompted to enter a recognizable date.</p></div>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_283">
Can I delete an employee from the database? If I delete an employee, can I add them back later?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>Yes, you can delete an employee record. Click&nbsp;<b><script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My Nonprofit TEXT")</script></b>, then under&nbsp;<b>Employee Records</b>, click&nbsp;<b>Employee Info</b>. Click the employee record you want to delete. On the Personal tab, click Delete.</p> <p>Deleting an employee record permanently erases all information associated with that record. If you have created a user account for that record, deleting the record also deletes the user account; that employee will no longer be able to sign in.</p> <p>Once you delete an employee record, you will not be able to add it back later. You will have to create a new employee record for that employee.</p></div>
