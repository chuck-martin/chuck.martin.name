<div class="topictitle">Creating a New Payroll</div>
<p>Creating a payroll is the process of collecting current employee HR, payroll, and time sheet information that will be consolidated into one report for submission to your payroll provider. Included in this process are the steps by which updates to employee data are reviewed and approved prior to being sent to your payroll processor.</p>

<h2>To create a payroll</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b><script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My Nonprofit")</script></b>, then under&nbsp;<b>Payroll</b>, click&nbsp;<b>Processing</b>.</li>
  <li>Select a Pay Frequency and a Pay Period.<br />
    Both of these were defined in payroll setup.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Create Payroll</b>.</li>
  <li>In the Pay Period Settings section, enter a&nbsp;<b>Check Date</b> (must be at least two business days from now if you are using InterPay). In the&nbsp;<b>Special Settings</b> section, enter any information specific to this payroll only. In the&nbsp;<b>Hold Settings</b> section, select any items that should be put on hold for this payroll only.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Select the employees for this payroll.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>For any employees who have had changes in their payroll records since the last payroll run, select whether these changes should be used for this payroll run.<br />
	Select&nbsp;<b>New Hire</b> when the employee is a new hire so InterPay can use that information to process new hire paperwork.<br />
    Select&nbsp;<b>Last Payment</b> when the person is no longer employed or this will be the last payroll the employee will be part of. InterPay may process final paperwork (such as a W-2)and send it to you.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Next</b>.<br />
  To view or edit the employee&#39;s time data, click the employee&#39;s name.<br />
  In the list of Exempt and Non-Exempt employees, flags appear next to an employee name when there  are relevant changes flowing through from the time sheet application that you might want to verify.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Override</b> if you want to override any compensation or deduction amount settings for any employee (for this payroll only).</li>
  <li>Select the employees to include on the printable payroll report (or for InterPay users, select the employees whose data you want to send to InterPay).</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Submit to InterPay</b>.<br />
    Click&nbsp;<b>Print Preview</b> to view the payroll. (From the view page, you can 
    also save it as a local file and print it out).<br />
  </li>
</ol>
