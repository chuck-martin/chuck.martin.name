<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_15">
What is Work Flow Manager&#153; messaging? How is it different from the Checklist Manager and Task Manager?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>Rivio has created Work Flow Manager, a communication tool that is similar to e-mail in that it enables users to send and receive messages via the Internet. However, Work Flow Manager messaging differs from regular e-mail in that business logic has been built in to allow workflow, tracking, archiving, and history. Work Flow Manager messaging enables communication between Rivio&#39s applications. Work Flow Manager acts as a workflow vehicle for the Task Manager and Checklist Manager applications. For example, when you send a Time Sheet or electronic form to someone in your company, Work Flow Manager is the communication tool that delivers and tracks the task.</p></div>
