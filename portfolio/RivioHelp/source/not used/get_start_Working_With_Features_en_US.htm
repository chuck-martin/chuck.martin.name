<p>This page gives you an overview of routine activities while working with features.</p>

<h2>Viewing and Sorting Lists</h2>
<p>Lists automatically display up to 10 records at a time by default. You can navigate through additional records by clicking a page number after&nbsp;<b>Go To Page</b>. As you pass your mouse over the page number, you&#39;ll see the index range of records contained on that page. To show all records in the list, click&nbsp;<b>Show All</b>.</p>
<p>Click a column header to sort any list. An arrow points up or down to indicate whether your list is sorted in ascending or descending order. </p>

<h2>Finding Records in a List</h2>
<p>You can quickly search for records in a list.</p>

<h2>To find a record in a list</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Open Search Box</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter the information for your search.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Search</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A list of records that fit your search criteria appears in the list.</p>

<h2>Sending Tasks and Forms</h2>
<p>The ability to send tasks and forms enables you to manage workflow between yourself and others. Features are integrated through the WorkFlow Manager messaging system, a communication tool similar to e-mail in that it enables you to send and receive messages via the Internet. However, it has built-in business logic to allow workflow, tracking, archiving, and history. It enables communication between applications, acting as a workflow vehicle. For example, when you send a Time Sheet or electronic form to someone in your company, the Task Manager messaging system is the communication tool that delivers and tracks the task. </p>
<p>You can forward, assign, or submit a task or form by clicking the appropriate button. You will be asked to either select a name from the drop-down list or to enter the e-mail address. You can include comments and can also indicate the date by which action should be taken.</p>
