<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_4">
Can I revoke account access of an employee for whom I have created a user account? If I revoke access, can I grant it again in the future?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>Yes, you can revoke access and grant it again if necessary. Revoking an employee&#39s access means that the employee no longer has access to the application, but you can still view their data. Revoking access has no effect on the employee&#39s record within the human resources database. You can see employees who do not have access in the Access Rights page. Click &nbsp;<b><script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My Nonprofit")</script></b>, then under&nbsp;<b>System Admin</b>, click&nbsp;<b>Access Rights</b>, then click&nbsp;<b>Assign Access</b> to view employees who have not yet been granted access.</p> <p>To grant access again to an employee (or to grant it initially), select the employee to whom you want to grant access, select the access right, then click&nbsp;<b>Create Account</b>.</p></div>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_8">
When I enter a date (such as a birth date), the system converts the format. What date formats can I use?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>The system displays dates in the format "mm/dd/yyyy". The system converts the date you enter to its display format. If the system cannot recognize the date, it does not save the data. You will see a data validation error message and be prompted to enter a recognizable date.</p></div>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_11">
When I create an employee record, do I have to enter their information all at once, or can the employee&#39s information be entered at a later date?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>You are not required to complete all of the information when adding an employee record. The only fields you need to complete to create an employee record are first and last name (on the Personal tab of the employee record). Either you or the employee can complete the personal, work and other information at a later date.</p></div>

<br />
<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_12">
Can I delete an employee from the database? If I delete an employee, can I add them back later?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>Yes, you can delete an employee record. Click&nbsp;<b><script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My Nonprofit TEXT")</script></b>, then under&nbsp;<b>Employee Records</b>, click&nbsp;<b>Employee Info</b>. Click the employee record you want to delete. On the Personal tab, click Delete.</p> <p>Deleting an employee record permanently erases all information associated with that record. If you have created a user account for that record, deleting the record also deletes the user account; that employee will no longer be able to sign in.</p> <p>Once you delete an employee record, you will not be able to add it back later. You will have to create a new employee record for that employee.</p></div>
