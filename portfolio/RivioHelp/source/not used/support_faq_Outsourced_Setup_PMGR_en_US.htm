What is outsourced setup?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer">Outsourced setup is a service that&nbsp;<script>TR("PARTNER")</script> offers to help you get started on your&nbsp;<script>TR("PRODNAME")</script> account as quickly as possible.  Once you&#39;ve registered to use&nbsp;<script>TR("PRODNAME")</script> and elected to utilize the outsourced setup service, your personal setup assistant will contact you to determine your exact needs and will then set up your site according to your instructions.</div>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_312">
How do I request outsourced setup?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>You must first register for&nbsp;<script>TR("PRODNAME")</script> before you can request outsourced setup.  After you register, you will arrive on a Setup Options page.  Select the first option, Outsource, and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>During outsourced setup, a temporary user account will be created for a representative of&nbsp;<script>TR("PARTNER")</script>. Upon completion of outsourced setup, you will disable this temporary user account. You will not incur any fees for this temporary account.</p>
<p>By requesting outsourced setup, you authorize access to and use of your data by a representative of&nbsp;<script>TR("PARTNER")</script> solely for the purpose of setting up your account.</p>

<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_313">
Who will perform outsourced setup?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer">Your setup assistant will be a representative of&nbsp;<script>TR("PARTNER")</script> who has been specifically trained to set up your site according to your instructions. Your setup assistant will contact you after you request outsourced setup on the site.</div>
<div align="right"><a href="#toc">Top</a></div>
<br />
<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_322">
How long will outsourced setup take?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer">How long outsourced setup takes depends on your specific setup needs. Regardless of the level of setup you request, your setup assistant will provide you with regular updates during the setup process.</div>

<br />
<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_315">
How secure is outsourced setup?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><script>TR("PARTNER")</script> takes the protection of your information very seriously -- from the time you provide your company information to a setup assistant designated by&nbsp;<script>TR("PARTNER")</script> until the setup assistant finishes setting up your account. Any information provided to the setup assistant in paper form will be locked in a locked file cabinet inside a locked room that is accessible by only properly authorized setup assistants. If your data is contained within computer files, we take precautions to prevent the files from being copied or forwarded. Once you have confirmed that setup is complete, we will destroy all data you submitted to us for setup purposes.</div>

<br />
<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_316">
Will the setup assistant be able to view my password?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer">No one, including your setup assistant, can view the password you have selected at any time. Nonetheless, we recommend changing your password periodically to insure the maximum level of security.</div>
<div align="right"><a href="#toc">Top</a></div>
<br />
<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_317">
Will you use my data for purposes other than outsourced setup?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer">No. Any data you submit to your setup assistant will be used strictly for the purpose of setting up your account.  Moreover, only&nbsp;<script>TR("PARTNER")</script> or its designated setup assistant will have access to your data.</div>
<div align="right"><a href="#toc">Top</a></div>
<br />
<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_323">
Why is my setup assistant requesting credit card information?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer">Some of the&nbsp;<script>TR("PARTNER")</script> services require you to pay a subscription fee and, consequently, some of the setup tasks that you request your setup assistant to perform may require your setup assistant to enter credit card information. You will not be asked to provide credit card information unless you have affirmatively elected a subscription&nbsp;<script>TR("PARTNER")</script> service.</div>
<div align="right"><a href="#toc">Top</a></div>
<br />
<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_320">
How do I disable my setup assistant?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>To disable your setup assistant, click&nbsp;<b><script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My NonProfit")</script></b>.  In the&nbsp;<b>System Admin</b> area, click&nbsp;<b>System Setup</b>, then click the&nbsp;<b>Disable Setup Assistant</b> icon.</p>
<b>Note</b>: You should disable the setup assistant only after you have been notified that outsourced setup of your account is complete and you have verified that your account has been set up according to your instructions. By disabling the setup assistant, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the manner in which your account has been set up and agree that it has been set up according to your instructions. If you disable the setup assistant before receiving notification that outsourced setup of your account is complete, you may interfere with successful completion of the setup process.</div>
