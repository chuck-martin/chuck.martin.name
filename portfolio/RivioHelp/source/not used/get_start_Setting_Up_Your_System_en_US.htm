<div class="topictitle">Setting Up Your System</div>

<p>You can choose to outsource your setup, delegate the setup among various administrators in your company, or complete the setup yourself. To complete setup, go to&nbsp;<b>System Admin</b>, click&nbsp;<b>System Setup</b>, then choose from the&nbsp;<b>Setup Options</b> available. Depending on your Administrator privileges, you will be responsible for setting up certain areas of the site. </p>

<p>Typically, setup begins by confirming and editing company information, and creating departments (if any). Setup continues by creating records for your employees, and granting access rights so they can access the system. Before your employees can use this site, you must create records for them, and then grant them access rights. </p>

<p>The setup wizards will walk you through each step of the process. If you are outsourcing your setup, a Setup Assistant will handle the process for you.</p>

<p>If you are an Administrator, you may wish to read the&nbsp;<a href="/ebopsweb/partners/Biztro/docs/Setup%20and%20Configuration%20Guide.pdf" target="_blank">System Setup and Configuration guide</a>. This manual contains useful information about the various administrative areas of the site, and how to get up-and-running. You will need Adobe Acrobat to view this manual. If you don’t have Adobe Acrobat installed on your computer,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
