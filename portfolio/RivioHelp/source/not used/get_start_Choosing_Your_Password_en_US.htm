<p>When your System Administrator activates an account for you,
you receive two e-mail messages. The first
e-mail contains the Company ID and User ID, the second e-mail has a new
randomly generated password. </p>



<p>When you sign in for the first time you are asked to change
your password, choose a secret question, and supply a secret answer. The secret
question and answer provides a safety mechanism to allow you to change your
password and access the site even if you have forgotten your password. Your
original password is no longer valid.</p>



<p>Be sure to choose a password that you can easily remember
and is 8-16 characters in length, with no spaces. It is good practice to use a
combination of letters and numbers, avoiding full words or names that are
easily discovered by others.</p>



<p>To gain access if you have forgotten your password, or wish
to change your password, you will need four pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Company ID</li>

<li>Your User ID</li>

<li>Your Work E-mail address</li>

<li>The answer to your secret question</li>
</ul>


<p>You can change your password at any time. </p>
