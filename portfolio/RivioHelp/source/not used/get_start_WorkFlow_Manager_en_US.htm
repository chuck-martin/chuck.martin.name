<p>When you assign a task or forward a form to someone, how do
you know they are working on it, or when it is complete? If you are like most
of us, you might easily forget to whom you gave the task or forget about it
altogether. </p>



<p>Suppose you send your request via e-mail. E-mail is a
send-and-forget medium. When you send a task through e-mail, you still have to
keep track of the task; you have to follow up. The person you assigned to the
task has no convenient way of keeping you informed about their progress. At
best they can report their efforts in a progression of separate, unrelated,
e-mails – which can easily get lost in a cluttered and busy inbox. </p>



<h2>WorkFlow Manager to the rescue </h2>



<p>This site contains a&nbsp;<i>WorkFlow Manager</i>&nbsp;-- a
send-and-monitor medium. When you send someone a task, the task appears in both
your task list and theirs, a constant reminder of the task to be done. Both of
you can update key elements of the task such as the progress status, the due
date, its priority, and instructions. Unlike e-mail, sending tasks opens a
channel of communication that remains open until the task is complete. </p>



<h2>Processing workflow tasks </h2>



<p>You can use the WorkFlow Manager to process routine forms.
For example, you can compose an Expense Report and send it to your supervisor
for online approval and processing. </p>



<p>You might say, &quot;I could just send my supervisor a
spreadsheet attached to an e-mail.&quot; But, so could your colleagues. Your
company bookkeeper must then cope with piles of individual spreadsheets which
aren’t necessarily standardized, each easily lost and all of them difficult to
consolidate. If you need to make a minor change, you must be sure that the old
spreadsheet is replaced with the revised one. Mistakes are inevitable. </p>



<p>The internal Expense Report tracking ensures expense
management is uniform throughout your company. All data are stored in the same
format in a single common database. This gives you these important advantages: </p>


<ul>
<li>Your attached Expense Report is the very same one
you’ve stored in your company database on this site</li>

<li>If you change it, the database is automatically updated</li>

<li>If your supervisor makes a change, her change goes
right into the database; </li>

<li>All recipients of your Expense Report share the same
copy of it and see all changes;</li>

<li>When your supervisor finally marks it
&quot;approved&quot;, the approval goes straight to the database.</li>
</ul>


<p>This data-sharing concept is an important property of the
WorkFlow Manager, and allows you to monitor: </p>

Expense Reports

Leave Requests

Time Sheets

Purchase Requests

Invoices

To Do items



<h2>Task Reminders</h2>



<p>You can set reminders to alert you when the task progress is
marked complete or alert you when the task has not been completed by the date
you specify. </p>



<h2>Delegating Tasks </h2>



<p>Perhaps, having received a task, you realize another person
should carry it out. You can re-assign it to that person and yet still monitor
the task from your list. </p>



<h2>Security </h2>

<p>Only you and the recipients of your tasks can see them.
Staff with administrator privileges can view certain types of tasks belonging
to you, but they cannot change the data they contain.</p>



<h2>To whom can I send a task? </h2>



<p>You can send a task to yourself as a reminder, or you can
send a task to anyone listed in your company directory. You can also send a
task to others using their e-mail address. </p>
