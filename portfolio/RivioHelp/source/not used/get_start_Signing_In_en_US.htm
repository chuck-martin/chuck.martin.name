<p>The Welcome page
asks you to &quot;Please Sign In.&quot; By signing in, you securely identify
your company and yourself.</p>

<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>

<p><a href="#signin">Sign in</a><br>
<a href="#remember">Have your computer remember your IDs</a><br>
<a href="#new">Get a new password during sign-in</a><br><br></p>

<a name="signin"></a><h2>To sign in</h2>

<p>You must enter correct information in three fields to be able to sign in. All three of these fields are required to uniquely identify you.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Company ID: This identifies your company. It is included in the e-mail notice that your System Administrator can send you when they set up your access to the system. </li>
 <li>User ID: This identifies you, within your company. The same User ID may be used at a different company; the combination identifies you. It is also included in the e-mail notice that your System Administrator can send you when they set up your access to the system.</li>
 <li>Password: This confirms that you are who you say you are. Your initial password is included in a separate e-mail notice from your System Administrator. </li>
</ul>

<p>When you have filled in all three required fields, click&nbsp;<b>Sign In</b>.</p>

<a name="remember"></a><h2>To have your computer remember your IDs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Select the&nbsp;<b>Remember IDs</b> box.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your browser will record your Company ID and your User ID in a &quot;cookie&quot; — a small file that your browser will show only to our system. The next time you come to this sign-in page, those items will be filled in for you. All you need to do is fill in your password.</p>

<p>For security, do not use this option on a computer you share with others.</p>

<a name="new"></a><h2>To get a new password during sign-in</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Forgot your password</b>? This takes you to&nbsp;<a href="get_start_Resetting_Forgotten_Password_en_US.htm">Resetting Your Password — Step 1</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the first time you are signing in, this option will not be available to you.</p>

<p>When you first signed in, you were asked to pick a secret question and supply a secret answer. This provides an alternate password mechanism that will allow you to access the site even if you have forgotten your password.</p>

<p>To gain access if you have forgotten your password, you will need four pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your Company ID </li>
  <li>Your User ID </li>
  <li>Your Work E-mail address </li>
  <li>The answer to your secret question </li>
</ul>

<p>If you successfully use this information to gain access to the system, confirmation e-mail notices will be sent to you and to your system administrator. This is an additional security measure that will inform you and your System Administrator in case someone successfully uses your Secret Answer.</p>
