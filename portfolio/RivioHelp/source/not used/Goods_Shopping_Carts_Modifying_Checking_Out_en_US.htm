         Products and services you select from item lists are placed in a
         shopping cart. The left menu displays the number and cost of items you
         have selected. You can view your shopping cart by clicking Shopping
         Cart on the left menu.
      </p>
      <h2>
         Modifying
      </h2>
      Your shopping cart offers several options for modifying its contents. You can:
<br />
      <ul>
         <li>
            Delete items by clicking the &nbsp;<b>X</b> to the left of the
            product or service name.
         </li>
         <li>
            Change the number of products ordered in the quantity field next to
            the product subtotal (on the right side of the page).
         </li>
         <li>
            If the vendor has not set a shipping method, select one using the
            drop-down list under the List Price column for all products.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
         Checking Out
      </h2>
      After making any necessary adjustments, you can check out items ordered
      from a particular vendor, or check out out your entire order (from all
      vendors). 
      <h2>
         To check out items from one vendor
      </h2>
     &nbsp;<br />
      <ul>
         <li>
            Click the &nbsp;<b>[Vendor Name] Checkout</b> button on the
            under the Subtotal column of the list of vendor&#39;s products
            selected.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
         To check out items from all vendors
      </h2>
     &nbsp;<br />
      <ul>
         <li>
            Click the &nbsp;<b>Check Out All Vendors</b> button on the
            lower right side of the page.
         </li>
      </ul>
      Both buttons open the Checkout page with buyer and payment information,
      and details on items ordered. 
      <h2>
         To complete the order
      </h2>
     &nbsp;<br />
      <ul>
         <li>
            Click Final Submit from this order summary page.
            Your credit card will be charged at this time.
         </li>
      </ul>
     <p><b>Note:</b> When you click Final Submit, the system sends the vendor your e-mail address, ship-to and payment details, and other information necessary to finalize the order. </p>
