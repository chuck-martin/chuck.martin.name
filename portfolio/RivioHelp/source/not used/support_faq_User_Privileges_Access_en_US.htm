<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_31">
What are the different roles and access rights?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>The System Administrator can assign different roles or access rights to different users. The information a user can see and the activities he can perform depend on his access rights. There are six different levels of access rights:</p> <ul>  <li>System Administrator</li>   <li>Human Resources (HR) Administrator</li>   <li>Accounting Administrator</li>   <li>Payroll Administrator</li>   <li>Manager</li>   <li>Employee </li> </ul><p>To see the descriptions for these levels, open System Admin, click on Access Rights, then click Assign Access. Open the user account for which you want to view or modify access rights.</p></div>
