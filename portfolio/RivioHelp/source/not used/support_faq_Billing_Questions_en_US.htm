<h2 class="question"><a name="FAQ_38">
When will my credit card be charged for my subscription and what do the charges represent?
</a>
</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>If you enrolled in a monthly subscription plan, your credit card will be charged on the first calendar day of each month following the date of your subscription. The initial charge will be the prorated charge for the previous month, and applicable usage-based fees for the previous month, and the monthly base subscription fee for the coming month. All subsequent charges will consist of two types of fees: a base subscription fee for that month and, if applicable, usage-based fees for activity in the preceding month.</p> <p>If you enrolled in an annual subscription plan, your credit card will be charged the annual base fee on the first calendar day of the month following your subscription date. If your plan charges usage-based fees, you will incur these fees on the first calendar day of each month following your subscription date; these fees are assessed based on activity in the preceding month.</p> <p>If your specific subscription plan includes an up-front promotional period (for example, no charges for 30 days), your credit card will be charged when that promotional period ends, in accordance with the timing described above.</p><p>To view the specifics of your plan, click&nbsp;<b><script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My Nonprofit")</script> > System Admin > Account Info</b>.
