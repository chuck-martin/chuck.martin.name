<div class="topictitle">Site Conventions</div>

<p>To help make this site easy to use, we follow the conventions described below.</p>

<h2>Required Fields</h2>
<p>A red asterisk (<span class="alert">*</span>) indicates a required field. You must enter information in this field before saving or moving to another page.</p>

<h2>Special Entry Formats</h2>
<p>Some fields require specific formats. For example, you may see a&nbsp;<b>Telephone No:</b> field followed by&nbsp;<b>xxx-xxx-xxxx</b>. Enter information according to that format, such as 408-123-4567.</p>

<h2>Date Entry Fields</h2>
<p>If supported by your browser, a calendar icon appears next to date entry fields. When you click the icon, a calendar appears. When you click on a date in the calendar, it appears in the date entry field. </p>

<h2>System Notices and Error Messages</h2>
<p>System notices and error messages appear in the upper part of the page to inform you of application warnings and errors, and tell you how to proceed. For example, when you attempt to save an item but have not entered information into a required field, you will see an error message at the top of the page instructing you to enter the required information.</p>

<h2>Wizards</h2>
<p>Wizards are contained throughout the site to assist you with special processes. Wizards appear in pop-up windows. You move through the wizard by clicking the&nbsp;<b>Next</b> and&nbsp;<b>Previous</b> links. A step indicator appears across the top of the wizard to tell you which step you’re on.</p>

<h2>Session Time Out Notice</h2>
<p>For security purposes, you are signed out of the site after an extended period of no activity. You will receive a message two minutes prior asking if you wish to continue working. If you do not respond within the two-minute period, you will automatically be signed out. To sign back in, return the sign-in page.</p>
