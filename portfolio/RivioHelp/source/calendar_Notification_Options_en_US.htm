<p>You can let the people in your company know when you are at a scheduled event 
  and unavailable. You can also add contact information if you can be reached 
  in other ways than normal (such as through your cell phone instead of your office phone). That notification is set up in this section under&nbsp;<b>Company 
  notification via employee locator</b> and then appears in the&nbsp;<a href="employee_locator_About_en_US.htm">Employee 
  Locator</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My Nonprofit")</script> &gt;&nbsp;<script>AltPartnerHTML("Company Info","B2P||Nonprofit Info")</script> &gt; Employee Locator.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select&nbsp;<b>Notify entire company of your out of office status</b> if you want 
  to be listed in the Employee Locator for this event&#39;s time. Then enter a reason, end 
  date, and any additional optional comments.</li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<b>Reachable</b> if you want to add information about how you can be 
  reached during this event. Then enter that information.</li>
</ul>
