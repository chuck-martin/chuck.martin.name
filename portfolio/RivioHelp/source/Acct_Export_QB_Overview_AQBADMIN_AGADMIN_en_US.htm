<p>Because Accounting and Human Resources are separate administrative privileges, whenever anyone with Accounting Administrator access exports Employee Records, e-mail is automatically sent to all HR Administrators notifying them of the records that have been exported.  This is a summary with a count of the records, not the details.</p>

<p>You can export Expense Reports to QuickBooks.  Expense Reports may not be exported until they have completed their approval process.  After an Expense Report is approved, it will be included in the next export of Expense Report data.</p>

<p>When you import Expense Report data into QuickBooks, they are entered as Accounts Payable (also called Bills in QuickBooks). </p>
