<!--<h1>
What is in the sample CSV file?
</h1>-->

<p>Most spreadsheet programs accept CSV files.  The sample CSV file can be imported into Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, or a similar spreadsheet program.  The sample contains a column-header row that briefly identifies what should be in each column, a few sample employee entries to illustrate the column contents, and some simple instructions.  While these are all useful in preparing your data, none of the sample file entries should be in your final data file.</p>

<p>Here are the columns in the sample file, with their intended uses:</p>
