<div class="topictitle">Modifying the Company Profile</div>

<p>Use the Company Profile form to enter information about your company.  Some of this was entered when you registered.  If you have the appropriate administrative privileges, you can change this information.</p>

<p>Most fields are self-explanatory.  Here is some information on other fields.</p>
<h2>Company ID</h2>
<p>The company ID is one of the pieces of information that all your users use to sign in to the site, so change this only if really necessary. If you do change the company ID, an e-mail will be sent to all the users in your company informing them of the change.</p>

<h2>Common Name vs. Legal Name</h2>

<p>Many companies have different ways of referring to themselves.  A company with a long name in its articles of incorporation often goes by initials or a shortened form of the name.  Occasionally, a company&#39;s legal name has nothing to do with how the company is known to its customers or employees.</p>

<p>The Common Name appears at the top of each page when you are using this system.  It will be used in e-mail messages to your employees and in other places.</p>

<p>The Legal Name is recorded with your Terms and Conditions agreement.  It is also part of the legal agreement implied when you purchase any goods or services through this system.</p>

<h2>About the Company</h2>

<p>Enter a short description of your company&#39;s role or mission here.  This will be available to all employees when they open the&nbsp;<script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My Nonprofit")</script> tab.</p>

<h2>Standard Industry Class (SIC) Code</h2>

<p>The Standard Industry Classification code is used to identify a type of business.  This code is used on your business income tax forms, among other places.  The SIC Code is required by some benefits services.  This field provides a convenient place to record this information so that you can easily find it again.  If you do not know the code for your business, enter 0000 or 9999 as a placeholder.  For more information, visit these URLs:</p>
