<p>Repeating events occur more than once at intervals you specify. Use the options 
  in this section to specify those interval options.</p>
<p>The default in this section is no repetition.</p>
<p>The second option is used for most repetition, where the interval can be anything 
  from daily to yearly. For example, for a birthday, which occurs on the same 
  date every year, you would select&nbsp;<b>Every</b> and&nbsp;<b>Year</b>, while for a 
  quarterly meeting, you would select&nbsp;<b>Every third</b> and&nbsp;<b>Month</b>.</p>
<p>The third option is used when the event will fall on a specific weekday of 
  a specific week. For example, in the U.S., Thanksgiving always falls on the 
  Thursday of the 4th week of November, so you would select&nbsp;<b>Fourth</b>,&nbsp;<b>Thursday</b>, and&nbsp;<b>Year</b>.</p>
<p>Use the other 2 options to Indicate if the repeating event has no end date 
  (<b>Always</b>), or ends on a specific date (<b>Until &lt;date&gt;</b>).</p>
