<div class="topictitle">Setting the Starting Expense Report and/or Invoice Numbers</div>

<p>The Expense/Invoice Setup page lets you specify starting numbers that are compatible with your Expense Report and Invoice numbering systems.  There are three fields to each number:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Prefix</b>: Use this if your number format has letter or number codes that come before the sequential number.  Include any separating punctuation, such as a dash or slash.</li>
  <li><b>Start Number</b>: This is a sequential number that is increased each time an approved Expense Report or Invoice is generated.  This field must be a number.</li>
  <li><b>Suffix</b>: Use this if your number format has letter or number codes that come after the sequential number.  Include any separating punctuation, such as a dash or slash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting these numbers is completely optional.  If you do not specify anything, no prefix or suffix will be used and the first Expense Report and first Invoice will each be numbered 000001.</p>

<h2>To set the starting number</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the prefix and/or suffix that your numbering system requires, if any.</li>
  <li>Enter a starting number that will be compatible with your other numbering.</li>
  <li>Click&nbsp;<b>Save</b>.</li>
</ol>
