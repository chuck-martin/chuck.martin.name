<p>Because Accounting and Human Resources are separate administrative privileges, whenever anyone with Accounting Administrator access imports Employee Records, e-mail is automatically sent to all HR Administrators notifying them of the records that have been imported.  This is a summary with a count of the records, not the details.</p>

<p>You can import Payment Terms from QuickBooks.  After the data file is imported, those terms are available in the Customer Detail screen.</p>

<p>The Accounts List and Customer List are completely compatible with the QuickBooks version; you can have parent accounts and up to four levels of child accounts under each parent.  If you have a deeply structured list in your QuickBooks, that will be preserved when you import it into our system.</p>
