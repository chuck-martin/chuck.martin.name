<div class="topictitle">About the QuickBook Interface</div>

<p>The Accounting area operates in two modes: with the QuickBooks&reg; interface on or off.  </p>

<p>When the QuickBooks interface is off, you have access to the Accounts List, Customer List, and Setup page but you cannot directly import or export data.  (In both modes you can import Employee Records using a CSV file through&nbsp;<script>AltPartnerHTML("My Company","B2P||My Nonprofit")</script>, Employee Records, Setup).</p>

<p>When the QuickBooks interface is on, you no longer have direct access to the Accounts List.  Instead you now have access to the Import, Export, and Re-Export functions, which allows you to import your account list, customer list, employee list, and credit terms.  For Export, your customer list, employee list, and the Accounts Payable generated by the Expense Reports system can be exported to QuickBooks.</p>
<p>While you have the QuickBooks Interface on, you can import your Chart of Accounts from QuickBooks and use it anywhere you would use the accounts created from the Account List.  When you turn the QuickBooks Interface off, you keep the imported chart of accounts.  However, if you turn the QuickBooks Interface off and modify your accounts, those changes cannot be exported to your QuickBooks system.</p>
