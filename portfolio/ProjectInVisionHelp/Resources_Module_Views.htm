 in a Project. The data is based on the Resources and Projects Filters 
 applied, as well as the Rollup, Grouping, and Date Ranges specified.</p>

<h3>Actual Work Pie Chart</h3>

<p>This View is a Pie Chart with slices based on Rollup selection and the 
 Date Range specified. Depending on the Rollup used, the Work Hours will 
 display for the specified Date Range, grouped by Rollup. The Rollup can 
 be Resource, Skill Category, Department, or Region. Under the Pie chart 
 is a list with information details. Fields: Project Number, Resource Name, 
 Resource Number, Actual Work, Billing Rate, and Actual Cost.</p>

<h3>Analysis Detailed </h3>

<p>This View shows information about Resource requirements on a Project-by-Project 
 basis. Numbers can be rolled up by Entire Resource Pool, Resource, Skill 
 Category, Department, or Region. The resulting numbers can be represented 
 as a percentage, as # of Resources, or Work hours.</p>

<h3>Analysis Overview</h3>

<p>This View shows summary information about Resource availability. Depending 
 on the <a href="View_Options.htm#Scale">Scale</a>, <a href="View_Options.htm#Rollup">Rollup</a>, 
 <a href="View_Options.htm#Representation">Representation</a>, and <a href="View_Options.htm#DateRange">Date 
 Range </a>applied to the data, you can see how much of a Resource's time 
 is available, how much is required, and how much is a surplus or a shortage. 
 Numbers can be rolled up by Entire Resource Pool, Resource, Skill Category, 
 Department, or Region.</p>

<h3>Analysis Requirement</h3>

<p>This View shows summary information about Resource requirements, represented 
 in terms of Work Hours to which the Resource has currently been assigned. 
 Depending on the <a href="View_Options.htm#Scale">Scale</a>, <a href="View_Options.htm#Rollup">Rollup</a>, 
 <a href="View_Options.htm#Representation">Representation</a>, and <a href="View_Options.htm#DateRange">Date 
 Range </a>applied to the data, you can see how much of a Resource's time 
 is required. As Resources are assigned to more Tasks, the Required Hours 
 are increased until the numbers appear in red (indicating a shortage) 
 or over-allocation of that Resource (more required hours than the Resource 
 can accomplish in the time frame specified). Numbers can be rolled up by 
 Entire Resource Pool, Resource, Skill Category, Department, or Region.</p>
