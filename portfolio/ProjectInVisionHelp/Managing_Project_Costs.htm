<h1>Managing Project Costs</h1>

<p>You can use Project InVision to track project costing data using the Costing 
  and Billing Pages of the Project Detail form. The Costing Page tracks the internal 
  cost of the project, while the Billing Page tracks customer billing or charge 
  back. </p>
<p>Both the Costing and Billing pages track three separate categories of costs: 
  Resource, Material and Expense. Resource costs can be entered manually or they 
  can be calculated based on the Current, Baseline and Actual work hours of Resource 
  assignments, multiplied by the hourly rate for Resources. Material and Expense 
  costs are always entered manually for Projects and rolled up into total project 
  costs.</p>
<h2>Project costs when there is an associated project schedule file</h2>

<p>When a project schedule file has been associated with a Project record, Resource 
  costing information can be calculated by the project management application 
  (such as Microsoft Project). That information is updated in Project InVision 
  during the synchronization process. Material and expense costs are entered directly 
  into Project InVision on the Costing and Billing pages of the Project Detail 
  form.</p>
<p class="note">When a project schedule file has been associated with the Project record, you 
  can still maintain Resource cost information directly in Project InVision, separate 
  from the associated project schedule file. See <a href="#tasklist">Project costs 
  when using a Project InVision Task List</a>.</p>

<h3>Resource Costs</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Resource cost rates (Internal Rate and Billing Rate) can be stored in Project 
    InVision and transferred to the associated project schedule files. (See <a href="About_Resource_Costing.htm">Resource 
    Costing</a>.) Your project management applications (such as Microsoft Project) 
    will calculate the costs for Tasks and Projects by multiplying these rates 
    times the Resource work assignments.</li>
  <li> To have the costs calculated by the project management application, enter 
    them in the Costing page of the <a href="Projects_Detail_Form.htm">Project 
    Detail form</a>. You should also define the following project options on the 
    Options page of the Project Detail Form:</li>
	<ul>
    <li> <b>Resource Current Cost Source</b> – Select <b>Project Schedule File</b> 
      to have the Current Cost from the associated project schedule file populated 
      to the Resource Current Cost field of the Project record.</li>
    <li> <b>Resource Baseline Cost Source</b> – Select <b>Project Schedule File</b> 
      to have the Baseline Cost from the associated project schedule file populated 
      to the Resource Base Cost field of the Project record.</li>
    <li> <b>Resource Actual Cost Source</b> – Select <b>Project Schedule File</b> 
      to have the Actual Cost from the associated project schedule file populated 
      to the Resource Actual Cost field of the Project record.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Material Costs</h3>

<ul>
  <li> You can enter and track materials costs directly in Project InVision on 
    the Costing or Billing pages of the Project Detail form.</li>
  <li> Project management applications, such as Microsoft Project, have the ability 
    to define &#8220;Material&#8221; type resources that can be assigned to Tasks. 
    If Material type resources are used in the project schedule file, the costs 
    associated with these resources will not synchronize directly with the Materials 
    costs fields in Project InVision. However, these costs will roll into the 
    total Task cost and total Project cost calculations in the project schedule 
    file. The total Task and total Project Cost numbers are synchronized with 
    Project InVision.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expense Costs</h3>

<ul>
  <li> You can enter and track expense costs directly in Project InVision on the 
    Costing or Billing pages of the Project Detail form.</li>
  <li> Project management applications, such as Microsoft Project, have the ability 
    to track &#8220;Expense&#8221; type costs as Fixed Costs on Tasks. If Fixed 
    Costs are used in the project schedule file, these costs will not synchronize 
    directly with the Expense costs fields in Project InVision. However, these 
    costs will roll into the total Task cost, and total Project cost calculations 
    in the project schedule file. The total Task and total Project Cost numbers 
    are synchronized with Project InVision.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tasklist"></a>Project costs when using a Project InVision Task List</h2>

<p>When the project schedule is maintained within Project InVision and there is 
  no project schedule file associated with the Project record, Resource costing 
  information can be calculated or entered into Project InVision in a number of 
  ways: User-entered, Resource Plan, or Task List Assignments. Material and expense 
  costs are entered directly into Project InVision on the Costing and Billing 
  Pages of the Project Detail Form.</p>
<h3>Resource Costs</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Resource cost rates (Internal Rate and Billing Rate) can be stored in Project 
    InVision, which will calculate the costs for Tasks and/or Projects by multiplying 
    these rates times the Resource work assignments in the Tasks module or Resource 
    Plan. (See <a href="About_Resource_Costing.htm">Resource Costing</a>.)</li>
  <li> To have the Resource costs calculated by the project management application 
    (such as Microsoft Project) populate the Costing page of the Project Detail 
    Form, define the following project options on the Options page of the Project 
    Detail form:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Resource Current Cost Source</b> </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Select <b>Current Resource Plan</b> to have the Current Resource Cost 
        calculated based on the data in the Current Resource Plan. See <a href="About_Resource_Plans.htm">Resource 
        Plans</a>.</li>
      <li> Select <b>Task List Assignments</b> to have the Current Resource Cost 
        calculated based on the resource task assignments. See <a href="About_the_Tasks_Module.htm">Tasks 
        Module</a>.</li>
      <li> Select <b>User-entered</b> to allow the Current Resource Cost to be 
        entered directly into the fields on the Billing and Costing pages of the 
        Project Detail form. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> <b>Resource Baseline Cost Source</b> </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Select <b>Baseline Resource Plan</b> to have the Baseline Resource 
        Cost calculated based on the data in the Baseline Resource Plan. See <a href="About_Resource_Plans.htm">Resource 
        Plans</a>.</li>
      <li> Select <b>User-entered</b> to allow the Baseline Resource Cost to be 
        entered directly into the fields on the Billing and Costing pages of the 
        Project Detail form. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> <b>Resource Actual Cost Source</b> </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Select <b>Time Tracking Actual Hours</b> to have the Actual Resource 
        Cost calculated based on the actual hours entered through Timesheets in 
        the Project InVision Time Tracking application. See <a href="About_Time_Tracking.htm">Time 
        Tracking</a>.</li>
      <li> Select <b>User-entered</b> to allow the Actual Resource Cost to be 
        entered directly into the fields on the Billing and Costing pages of the 
        Project Detail form. </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Material Cost</h3>

<ul>
  <li> You can enter and track materials costs directly in Project InVision on 
    the Costing or Billing pages of the Project Detail form.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expense Costing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can enter and track expense costs directly in Project InVision on the 
    Costing or Billing pages of the Project Detail form.</li>
</ul>
