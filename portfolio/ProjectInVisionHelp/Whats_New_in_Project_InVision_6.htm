<h1>What's New in Project InVision 6?</h1>

<p>Project InVision 6 is a new release from Project InVision International that 
  significantly improves its usability and performance. The entire interface has 
  been redesigned to improve the user experience. In addition, there are a large 
  number of significant changes from previous versions of Project InVision.</p>

<h3>Project Portal </h3>
<p>A new “project” portal that displays the selected project’s health and all 
  of the project's associated details within each of the supporting modules (issues, 
  risks, change requests, documents, etc.). The Project Portal is customizable, 
  enabling each organization to include the most relevant views to meet their 
  users' requirements. </p>
<h3>My InVision Portal</h3>
<p>A new “user” portal that displays all relevant items related to the user, including 
  their task assignments, issues, risks, change requests and more. </p>
<h3>Search </h3>
<p>A new powerful search helps users to quickly find records by searching for 
  phrases across multiple modules (Projects, Issues, Defects, etc.) to find every 
  instance of the search phrase.</p>
<h3>Project Scorecards </h3>
<p>Project Scorecards enable users to analyze their project portfolio by ranking 
  and prioritizing project requests. Each scorecard is completely customizable 
  to meet each organization's unique prioritization requirements. The portfolio 
  can then be analyzed graphically utilizing the new bubble charts or through 
  scorecard columnar views. </p>
<h3>Transfer</h3>
<p>A powerful new transfer feature lets users copy or move a record within modules 
  in the current project or to another project.</p>
<h3>Chart Views</h3>
<p> A new charting capability expands the graphical views for all modules with 
  new chart types including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Columnar / Bar Charts</li>
  <li>Pie Charts</li>
  <li>Bubble Charts</li>
  <li>And more….</li>
</ul>
<h3>Templates </h3>
<p>Quickly review templates before making a selection and association to projects. 
</p>
<h3>Links </h3>
<p>Links have been improved in three sections within Project InVision. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Links within email Alerts will take users directly to the linked record 
    within Project InVision.</li>
  <li>Hyperlinks within tables allow users to quickly access details.</li>
  <li>The process of linking to new records from all modules has been simplified, 
    allowing users to add records while creating a link.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Report Enhancements </h3>
<p>Project InVision reports have been rewritten with a new look and added functionality, 
  including drill-down, and a number of powerful new reports have been added. 
  Cross-workgroup reporting has also been expanded to allow users to select one 
  or more workgroups as report criteria.</p>
<h3>Calculated Fields </h3>
<p>Create custom calculations to support your business needs. An example of how 
  calculated fields can be used is the ability to weight portfolio analysis scorecard 
  criteria. </p>
<h3>Default Fields </h3>
<p>Define default values for fields to expedite the entry of project related data. 
</p>
<h3>Custom Forms</h3>
<p>Define the tab order and add text labels on your custom details forms. </p>
