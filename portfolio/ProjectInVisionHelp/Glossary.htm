<dl>
	<dt>ActiveX Control</dt>
	<dd>A software component that controls the 
 way that data is presented is a Web browser. For example, an ActiveX control 
 may allow users to see data in a grid or dates to appear as if they are 
 part of a calendar. ActiveX Controls are used to display information in 
 Project InVision.</dd>
  <dt>Advanced Filters</dt>
  <dd>Multiple-criteria SQL queries that can be built in Project InVision so that 
    data may be filtered into more relevant information. Users are able to create 
    advanced Filters for any module, at the Enterprise, Workgroup, or personal 
    level, provided that they have been granted permission. </dd>
	
	<dt>Alert</dt>
	
	
  <dd>A Project InVision message to a user. Alerts may be a system-generated message 
    when an event occurs or may be entered and sent by another Project InVision 
    user.</dd>
	
	<dt>Archiving</dt>
	
	<dd>The process of removing excess (typically 
 older) data and storing it elsewhere. This ensures that only current data 
 is viewable by users, but still provides the ability to retrieve the information 
 from the Archives.</dd>
	
	<dt>Associated Files</dt>
	
	
  <dd>Associated files are linked to a record in either the Documents or the Projects 
    modules so you can check in, check out, or review a file. </dd>

  <dt>Check In</dt>
  <dd>This is the process of taking a file from the user's desktop and transferring 
    it to the Project InVision server so that it becomes available to other users 
    of the application. The Checked In file becomes associated with the corresponding 
    Project or Document record selected when the file was transferred. In the 
    Project module, Project schedule files may be Checked In to the application. 
    In the Documents module, any file type can be Checked In and associated with 
    a Document record. The only stipulation is that the user must have been granted 
    the appropriate rights to Check In Project schedules or Documents. </dd>
  <dt>Check Out</dt>
  <dd>This is the process of taking a file from the Project InVision server and 
    transferring it to the user's desktop so that the file can be edited. Once

    between applications. </dd>
  <dt>System Administrator</dt>
  <dd>An individual that is responsible for the installation, upgrading, and maintenance 
    of the Project InVision application. Generally a technical person, the System

<dl>
  <dt>Tasks</dt>
  <dd>Work that must be performed on a Project. Each Task has a Start Date, a 
    Finish Date, a Duration, and an amount of work that must be performed. Resources 
    are then assigned to these Tasks so that Actual Work Hours may be posted against 
    the Tasks in the Time Tracking application. </dd>
  <dt>Templates</dt>
  <dd>Pre-defined files that are used to create new Documents or Project Schedule 
    Templates in Project InVision. Templates are used to ensure that a consistent 
    Project Management approach is maintained by providing approved templates 
    of Documents and Project schedules. This ensures that every Resource who is 
    working on the Project is providing data using the same mechanisms, and that 
    these mechanisms are consistent across the Enterprise. </dd>
  <dt>Time Tracking</dt>
  <dd>An application of the Project InVision suite that allows you to track their 
    time against specific Tasks, Issues, Defects, Change Requests, Risks, or Requirements.

	<dt>Views</dt>
	
	
  <dd>The way that data is presented in the main window of the application. A 
    View is determined by the fields that are displayed in the main window, the 
    column order in which they are displayed, and the default width of each column 
    as it is displayed. The Views are saved in the Project InVision application

    have when moving from one status to another.</dd>
	
	<dt>Workgroup</dt>
	
	<dd>A large container where similar Projects

 procedures, pull-down values, and user access. If similar information 
 is captured in various fields at the Project, Resource, Facilities, Documents, 
 Issues, Defects, Journal, Collaboration, Risk, Change Request, or Requirements 
 level, then the Projects can be maintained in one Workgroup. If different 
 information should be captured at any of these levels for different groups 
 of Projects, then multiple Workgroups should be used. </dd>
	
	<dt>Workgroup Administrator</dt>
	
	<dd>An individual that is responsible for 
 the configuration of the Project InVision application, including the naming
