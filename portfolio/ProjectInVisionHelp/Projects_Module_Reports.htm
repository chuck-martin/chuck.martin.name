<h1>Projects Module Reports</h1>

<p>Projects module Reports contain information related to Projects and their status 
  across the Enterprise. The Reports available for the Projects module are described 
  below (with Report Options), along with a description of the Report and the 
  fields that are captured.</p>

<p class=note>Reports may be customized by the Workgroup Administrator 
 or a Report Writer, so some fields may not exist or may be labeled differently 
 than shown here.</p>

<h3>Projects Status (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This summary Report allows Managers to see how Projects are progressing and 
  contains the fields Project Number, Project Title, Type, Manager, Status, % 
  Complete, and Current Finish.</p>
<h3>Projects Status - Actual (Projects Filter)</h3>

<p>This list Report shows Projects' Status based on Actual Work Hours booked 
 against Tasks through the <a href="About_Time_Tracking.htm">Time Tracking</a> 
 application. It allows Managers to see how Projects are progressing, when 
 they actually started, their actual target finish date, how many Work 
 Hours have been charged to each Project, and the current cost of the Project 
 based on the Cost rates charged per Actual Work Hour by Resources assigned 
 to the Project. Report fields: Project Number, Project Title, Manager, 
 Sponsor, Status, Actual Start, Actual Finish, Actual Work, and Actual 
 Cost.</p>

<h3>Projects Status - Current (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This list Report shows the current status of Projects based on the updated 
  Project schedule. This information could be different from the original Baseline 
  plan or the actual results that are being recorded against the Project. It allows 
  Managers to see the planned progress of the Project, the current Start and Finish 
  Dates, the Current Work Hours required, the Current Cost of the Project based 
  on the Cost rates, and the % of the Project that is complete. Project fields: 
  Project Number, Project Title, Manager, Sponsor, Status, Current Start, Current 
  Finish, Current Work, Current Cost, % Work Complete, and % Complete.</p>
<h3>Projects Status - Cost (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This list Report shows the true cost of Projects based on Current, Baseline, 
  and Actual Costs as posted to Tasks through the <a href="About_Time_Tracking.htm">Time 
  Tracking</a> application. It allows Managers to see exactly how much Projects 
  are costing, the total Remaining Cost for the Project, and the total Variance 
  Cost based on Actual versus Baseline Costs. Project fields: Project Number, 
  Project Title, Manager, Sponsor, Status, Current Cost, Baseline Cost, Actual 
  Cost, Total Remaining, and Total Variance Cost.</p>
<h3>Projects Status - Work (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report shows the Current, Baseline, and Actual Work values of Projects. 
  This allows Managers to see how much Work is being performed on Projects. Project 
  fields: Project Number, Project Title, Manager, Sponsor, Status, Current Work, 
  Baseline Work, Actual Work, Remaining Work, and Work Variance. </p>
<h3>Projects List (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This list Report lists all Projects. Project fields: Project Number, Project 
  Title, Department, Manager, Sponsor, and Status.</p>
<h3>Projects List - Condition (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This list Report shows the condition of Projects based on the Condition field, 
  which is updated by the Project Manager. It allows Managers to see the overall 
  health of Projects and understand how they are progressing. Project fields: 
  Condition, Project Number, Project Title, Status, Manager, and Sponsor.</p>
<h3>Projects List - Schedule (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report shows Current Project Start and Finish Dates. Project fields: Project 
  Number, Project Title, Manager, Status, Current Finish, and Current Start.</p>
<h3>Projects Summary (Projects, Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report shows summary information for all Projects or one selected Project. 
  For each Project record, the Report has four sections: high-level Project information, 
  Task Summary information, Key Deliverables, and Open Issues. Project fields: 
  Project Number, Project Title, Type, Priority, Manager, Sponsor, Originator, 
  Department, Region, Status, Project Status Modified by information, and the 
  associated project schedule file. Project Comments are captured at the bottom 
  of the Report.</p>
<p>The Task Summary section charts Current, Baseline, and Actual, Remaining and 
  Variance values against Start Dates, Finish Dates, Durations, and Work, along 
  with% Complete and % of Work Complete. For Tasks that have been identified in 
  your project management application as Key Deliverables (i.e., The &#8220;Marked&#8221; 
  field equals Yes), the Key Deliverables section shows the Task Number, Task 
  Name, Current Start, Current Finish, and % Complete so you can see the progress 
  of Key Project Deliverables without Checking Out the Project Schedule. The Open 
  Issues section shows which Issues are outstanding, when they are due, and who 
  is responsible for each Issue and uses the fields Issue Number, Issue Title, 
  Date Opened, Date Due, and Responsible.</p>
<h3>Projects Schedule - Baseline (Projects Filter)</h3>

<p>This list Report shows the baseline settings of Projects in a list based 
 on information entered by the Project Manager. It allows Managers to see 
 exactly when the Projects were estimated to Start, Finish, and Cost. Report 
 fields: Project Number, Project Title, Manager, Sponsor, Status, Baseline 
 Start, Baseline Finish, Baseline Work, and Total Base Cost.</p>

<h3>Projects Schedule - Current vs. Baseline (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This list Report compares the Current Start and Finish Dates against the Baseline 
  Start and Finish Dates to show the variance between them. This allows you to 
  see if the Project started and will finish on time as compared to the baseline. 
  Project fields: Project Number, Project Title, Manager, Sponsor, Status, Current 
  Start, Baselines Start, Start Variance, Current Finish, Baseline Finish, and 
  Finish Variance.</p>
<h3>Projects Schedule - Variance (Projects Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report shows the averages of Start, Finish, Duration, Work, and Cost Variances. 
  Project fields: Project Number, Project Title, Manager, Sponsor, Status, Start 
  Variance, Finish Variance, Duration Variance, Work Variance, and Cost Variance.</p>
<h3>Projects Count (Projects Filter, Rollup)</h3>

<p>This chart Report shows a count of Projects, separated into groups determined 
 by the Rollup selection, plus a total count. The counts are grouped by 
 the values in the Rollup field. Numbers can be rolled up by Type, Priority, 
 Status, Condition, Department, Region, Manager, Sponsor, Originator, Billing 
 Code, or Cost Center.</p>

<h3>Projects Count - My Projects (Projects Filter, Rollup)</h3>
<p>This chart Report shows a total count of Projects, separated into groups determined 
  by the Rollup selection, and the number of Projects per Rollup group where you 
  are the Manager. The counts will be grouped by the selected Rollup. Numbers 
  can be rolled up by Type, Priority, Status, Condition, Department, Region, Manager, 
  Sponsor, Originator, Billing Code, or Cost Center.</p>
<h3>Projects Matrix (Projects Filter)</h3>

<p>This chart Report shows a matrix that compares Project Condition to 
 Project Priority.</p>

<h3>Projects Pie Chart (Projects Filter, Rollup, Content)</h3>

<p>This chart Report shows Projects rolled up by a particular item (Status, Type, 
  Department, etc.).</p>
<h3>Projects Overview (Projects, Tasks Filter)</h3>
