<h1>Issues Module Reports</h1>

<p>Issues module Reports contain information related to Issues and the Status 
  of Issues across the Enterprise. The Reports available for the Issues module 
  are described below (with Report Options), along with a description of the Report 
  and the fields that are captured.</p>

<p class=note>Reports may be customized by the Workgroup Administrator 
 or a Report Writer, so some fields may not exist or may be labeled differently 
 than shown here.</p>

<h3>Issues List - Details (Projects, Issues Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report shows detailed information about Issues that exist for selected 
  Projects, Project fields: Project Number, Project Title, Issue Number, Issue 
  Title, Submitted by, Responsible, Description, Resolution, Date Opened, Date 
  Due, Date Completed, Status, Priority, and Impact.</p>
<h3>Issues List - Status (Projects, Issues Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report shows Issue Status for Projects, grouped by Project. Project fields: 
  Project Number, Project Title, Issue Number, Issue Title, Submitted by, Responsible, 
  Date Opened, Date Due, Status, and Priority.</p>
<h3>Issues Count (Projects, Issues Filter, Rollup)</h3>
<p>This Report shows a total count of Issues, separated into groups by Rollup. 
  Numbers can be rolled up by Type, Priority, Severity, Status, Responsible, Submitted 
  by, or Project.</p>
<h3>Issues Count - My Issues (Projects, Issues Filter, Rollup)</h3>
<p>This Chart shows a total count of Issues and the Issues you're responsible 
  for separated into groups by Rollup. Numbers can be rolled up by Type, Priority, 
  Severity, Status, Responsible, Submitted by, or Project.</p>
<h3>Issues Count Pie (Projects, Issues Filter, Rollup)</h3>
<p>This Report shows a Pie Chart of Issues by the selected Rollup, followed by 
  a table with details of the Issues, grouped by Rollup. Numbers can be rolled 
  up by Type, Priority, Severity, Status, Responsible, Submitted by, or Project. 
  Project fields: Issue Number, Issue Title, Status, and Count.</p>
<h3>Issue Pie Chart - Actual Work (Projects, Issues Filter, Projects Filter, Rollup, 
  Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>

<p>This Report shows a Pie Chart of Work Hours over the specific Date Range, 
 along with a table showing the same data, grouped by Rollup. Numbers can 
 be rolled up by Type, Priority, Severity, Status, Responsible, Submitted 
 by, or Project. The Report will then display the existing values for the 
 Rollup field and the total number of Issues displaying that value. Project 
 fields: Issue Number, Issue Title, Status, Actual Work, and Timesheet 
 Date.</p>

<h3>Issues Matrix (Projects, Issues Filter)</h3>

<p>This Report compares Issue Severity to Issue Priority, identifying High
