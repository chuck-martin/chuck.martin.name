<h1>About Portfolio Manager</h1>

<p>The Portfolio Manager application contains and organizes all the information 
  about your projects and is part of the Project InVision suite. You can use Portfolio 
  Manager to manage a portfolio of projects for a program, a department, or the 
  whole enterprise. </p>
<p>Portfolio Manager contains several modules, which are used to capture information 
  related to projects. Standard modules include Resources, Tasks, Issues, Defects, 
  and more. For more information, see <a href="Modules.htm">Modules</a>.</p>
<p>Portfolio Manager also includes <a href="About_Portals.htm">Portals</a>, which 
  are cross-module views of important information. For example, standard Portals 
  include My InVision, which contains snapshot views of projects you're responsible 
  for, and Project Portal, which contains high-level status of a project or program.</p>
<h2>Working in Portfolio Manager</h2>


  
<p> Portfolio Manager contains a main section for displaying information and controls 
  for changing the display of that information and for switching between modules 
  in the Portfolio Manager application. The Application menu in the top-left section 
  of the page (next to the Project InVision logo) controls what application you 
  are in: Portfolio Manager, <a href="About_Time_Tracking.htm">Time Tracking</a>, 
  or <a href="About_Dashboard.htm">Dashboard</a>. Links in the upper-right are 
  common to all applications and provide access to personalization, messaging, 
  and help.</p>
  <p>When you log in to Project InVision, you view all the modules within a specific 
    <a href="About_Workgroups.htm">Workgroup</a>. Module records are often viewed 
    in lists, which share common functionality such as <a href="About_Views.htm">views</a>, 
    <a href="About_Filters.htm">filtering</a>, and <a href="About_Grouping.htm">grouping</a>, 
    as well as charts and graphs. What you can see and do in modules is determined 
    by your security and user permissions, which are set by the Workgroup Administrator.</p>
  
<p>The Module links on the left duplicate the selections in the Modules menu in 
  the <a href="Navigation_Menu.htm">Navigation Menu</a>, allowing one-click access 
  to different modules. The Navigation Menu across the top of the page controls 
  what you see and how you see it. Underneath the Navigation Menu is the toolbar, 
  which contains commands for Project InVision functions. On the left end of the 
  toolbar is the button for the Selector, which toggles a hierarchical list of 
  projects. </p>
  
<p>The information displayed is determined by the Module that has been selected, 
  the View that has been applied, plus any Filter or Group By selections that 
  have been made. List view information is presented in a spreadsheet format, 
  with rows representing single records and columns representing data for each 
  record.</p>
<h2>Module List Modes</h2>
  <p>Module lists have two modes: Read Only and Editable. In Read Only 
    mode, many fields are links. Clicking on the links will open the Detail Form 
    for that record. In Editable mode, you can click in the field and edit the 
    information directly. See <a href="Editing_Information.htm">Editing Information</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click on a non-link field in any record in a list view to open its 
    associated Detail Form.</li>
  <li>Click a link field in any Record in a list view in Read Only view to open 
    the Detail Form for that field.</li>
  <li>Single-click in any column of a record in a list view to edit the specific 
    field (if the View is editable).</li>
  <li>Click the vertical scroll bar on the right to scroll up and down in a list 
    view.</li>
  <li>Click the horizontal scroll bar to view more data columns.</li>
  <li>Click More or All to see more records in a list view.</li>
  <li>Click and drag on the right border of a column header to change the column 
    width.</li>
  <li>Click on the column header and drag it to the desired location to rearrange 
    the column order.</li>
  <li>Click and drag on the bottom border of a row header to change all row heights. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p class=note>Changes to column width, column order, and row height are 
 reset to their default values when you change views, apply a filter, or 
 refresh the list.</p>
