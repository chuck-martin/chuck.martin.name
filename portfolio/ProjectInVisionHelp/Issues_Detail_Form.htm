<h1>Issues Detail Form</h1>

<p>This form contains information about an Issue as it is tracked from discovery 
  through evaluation to resolution. The form includes several pages, each containing 
  a specific type of information. Click the links under Pages to view each page. 
  The form also has its own toolbar that allows quick access to common functions.</p>

<h2>Issues Detail Form Pages&nbsp;</h2>

<p class=note>These are the default pages. Your Workgroup Administrator 
 may have renamed existing pages or added new ones, or may have renamed, 
 added, or deleted fields within any page.</p>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>This page shows Issues-related information, such as the description 
 of the Issue, its impact, any Resolution, the Type of Issue, its Priority 
 and Severity, and which Resources are involved in the Issue. Dates are 
 used to track when the Issue was Opened, Due, and Closed.</p>

    the date, time, and User responsible for the change. Click the Status label
