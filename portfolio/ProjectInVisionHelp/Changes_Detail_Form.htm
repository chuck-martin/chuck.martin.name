<h1>Changes Detail Form</h1>

<p>This form contains information about a Change request, information related 
  to tracking the Change from definition through evaluation to resolution. The 
  form contains several pages, each containing a specific type of information. 
  Click the links under Pages to view each page. The form also has its own toolbar 
  that allows quick access to common functions.</p>

<h2>Changes Detail Form Pages</h2>

<p class=note>These are the default pages. Your Workgroup Administrator 
 may have renamed existing pages or added new ones, or may have renamed, 
 added, or deleted fields within any page.</p>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>This page shows Change-related information, such as the description 
 of the Change, its impact, the Business Case behind it, the Type of Change, 
 its Priority and Complexity, and which Resources might be involved in 
 implementing the Change. Dates are used to track when the Change was Evaluated 
 and Closed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Change #</B></span> is generated by Project 
    InVision and is not editable. It is one way to identify the Change.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Change Title</B></span> is a brief (up to 40 
    characters) description of the Change.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Description</B></span> can contain as much 
    text as necessary; enter and add details as the Change progresses through 
    the workflow.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Impact</B></span> is a brief (up to 255 characters) 
    description of potential consequences that could occur if the Change is implemented.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Business Case</B></span> can contain as much 
    text as necessary to document the business reasons for making the change.</li>
  <li><a href="About_Workflows.htm"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Workflow</B></span></a> defines the order in which the 
    Status of a particular record may be changed in Project InVision. Each time 
    the Status of a Project InVision record is changed, Project InVision logs 
    the date, time, and User responsible for the change. Click the Status label 
    to see Status History.<span class=note><br>
    The Workgroup Administrator defines the Workflows that are available for each 
    individual Workgroup. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Status</B></span> defines steps within a workflow.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Status Revised</B></span> is an uneditable 
    field that shows who updated the Change to the current status and when.</li>
  <li><b>Type</b> is the type of the Change, used to categorize and search for 
    Change records.</li>
  <li><b>Priority</b> is the priority of the Change, used to categorize and search 
    for Change records.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Complexity</B></span> is the priority of the 
    Change, used to categorize and search for Change records.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Submitted By</B></span> is the Resource who 
    suggested the Change.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Responsible</B></span> is the Resource who 
    is currently responsible for the Change at this status in the workflow.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Task Name</B></span> is the Task that the Change 
    is associated with. If a Change is associated with a specific Task, then the 
    Change is displayed in the Time Tracking application so that time can be posted 
    against the Change and rolled up into the Project Task. See <a href="About_Time_Tracking.htm">Time 
    Tracking</a>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Evaluation Date</B></span> is the date that 
    the Change was first suggested (which may be before it was actually entered 
    into Project InVision).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Date Closed</B></span> is the date the Change 
    was actually completed (if the change was accepted) or the date the Change 
    was deferred or refused.</li>
</ul>
