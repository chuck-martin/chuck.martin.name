<h1>Resources Detail Form</h1>

<p>The Resources Detail Form contains information about Resources, including Name, 
  Title, Department, Region, Manager, skills, availability, contact information, 
  etc. The form contains several pages, each containing a specific type of information. 
  Click the links under Pages to view each page. The form also has its own toolbar 
  that allows quick access to common functions.</p>

<h2>Resources Detail Form Pages&nbsp;</h2>

<p class=note>These are the default pages. Your Workgroup Administrator may have 
  renamed existing pages or added new ones, or may have renamed, added, or deleted 
  fields within any page.</p>

<h3>Information</h3>

  Name, Last Name, Title, Region, Manager, Department, Billing Rate, Internal 
  Rate, Billing code, and Cost Center. You can also see the User Login, which 
  is not editable. You can mark the Resource as Active or Inactive (inactive Resources 
  are not available to assign to Projects or Tasks) or as a Generic Resource (Generic 
  Resources have no First Name or UserID and are used for planning).</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>First Name</b> is the first or given name of the Resource and is available 
    only when the Generic check box is cleared.</li>
  <li><b>MI</b> is the first letter of the Resource's middle name and is available 
    only when the Generic check box is cleared.</li>
  <li><b>Last Name</b>/<b>Name</b> is the last or family name of the Resource

    Resource costs belong to.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Cost Center</B></span> identifies what department 
    is responsible for paying Resource costs.</li>
  <li><b>Skill Category</b>, defines skills that the Resource has and is used 
    for searching and in defining what Resources are appropriate and available 
    for Projects.</li>
  <li><b>Level</b> identifies the experience level of the Resource and is used 
    for searching and in defining what Resources are appropriate and available 
    for Projects.</li>
  <li><b>Manager</b> is the Resource's direct report and defines where information 
    and documents go in some workflows.</li>
  <li><b>Primary Workgroup</b> is the Project InVision Workgroup that the Resource 
    enters by default when logging in.</li>

  <li><b>Internal Rate</b> is the amount charged per hour to internal clients.</li>
  <li><b>Active</b> defines whether the Resource is available to work on Projects.</li>

    box is cleared) or a template that can be added to a project that will later 
    be filled with a real person.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contact Info</h3>

<p>This page contains Resource contact information such as telephone numbers, 
  email addresses, and home addresses. You can store multiple phone numbers and 
  Email addresses in this page. See <a href="Editing_Contact_Information.htm">Editing 
  Contact Information</a>.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>This page is for free-form comments that are maintained with the Resource record. 
  See <a href="Detail_Form_Common_Pages.htm#Comments">Detail Forms: Common Pages, 
  Comments.</a></p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p>This page contains an uneditable hierarchical view of the Projects, Tasks, 
  and Task-related items (Issues, Defects, Risks, Changes, and Requirements) that 
  a Resource has been assigned to. </p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>This page shows Resource skills. This information is used to filter Resource 
  records to find people who have certain skills or sets of skills. You can store 
  multiple skills in this page. See <a href="Editing_Skills.htm">Editing Skills</a>.</p>

<p class=note>The Workgroup Administrator configures the Skill values based 
 on the needs of the Workgroup.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>This page is where you identify when you are working on Non-Project Activities 
  and are unavailable for Task assignments, and when you are unavailable (or available) 
  for only part of the work week. See <a href="Editing_Availability.htm">Editing 
  Availability</a>. </p>

<p>The Availability Profile and Non-Project Activity information is related 
 to Resource Planning. When Resource Plans are developed, Analysis Reports 
 can compare the Resource requirements against availability of Resources. 
 Managers can then see if a specific Resource can be assigned to a Project 
 or if that Resource is over-allocated for the time period. For more information 
 on Resource Planning, see <a href="About_Resource_Plans.htm">Understanding 
 Resource Plans</a>.</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>This page contains Keywords, which are values defined by the Workgroup Administrator that can be used as filters when searching. See <a href="Detail_Form_Common_Pages.htm#Keywords">Detail 
  Forms: Common Pages, Keywords.</a></p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>This page contains links to other records within Project InVision or to web addresses 
  outside Project InVision. Links within Project InVision help you track associations 
  between Projects and other items, such as Tasks and Resources. See <a href="Detail_Form_Common_Pages.htm#Links">Detail 
  Forms: Common Pages, Links.</a></p>
