<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This page shows a high-level summary of project schedule information, including 
  actual vs. baseline comparisons, to support the quick identification of variances. 
  The information displayed in the Summary page is rolled up from the various 
  Tasks captured in the Tasks module.</p>

<h3>Key Deliverables</h3>

<p>This page shows summary information about key dates in the progress of a project.</p>

<p> In the Tasks module, selecting the Key Deliverable check box on the Task record 
  identifies it as a Key Deliverable. If the Project has an attached project schedule 
  file, any task where the &#8220;Marked&#8221; field is set to &#8220;Yes&#8221; 
  is regarded as a Key Deliverable by Project InVision and is displayed in Key 
  Deliverable Views and Reports. For information on marking tasks, see your project 
  management application documentation.</p>

<p>This page shows all Resources that have been defined as part of the Project 
  Team. Resources that are assigned to the Project in Project InVision are also 
  posted to the Resource Sheet of the associated project schedule file. Resources 
  that have been assigned to the Project are available to be assigned to Tasks.</p>
