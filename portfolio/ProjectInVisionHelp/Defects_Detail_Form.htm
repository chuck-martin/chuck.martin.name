<h1>Defects Detail Form</h1>

<p>This form contains information about Project Defects related to tracking the 
  Defect from discovery through evaluation to resolution. The form contains several 
  pages, each containing a specific type of information. Click the links under 
  Pages to view each page. The form also has its own toolbar that allows quick 
  access to common functions.</p>

<h2>Defects Detail Form Pages&nbsp;</h2>

<p class=note>These are the default pages. Your Workgroup Administrator 
 may have renamed existing pages or added new ones, or may have renamed, 
 added, or deleted fields within any page.</p>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>This page shows Defect-related information, such as the description of the 
  Defect, its cause, any Resolution, the Type of Defect, its Priority and Severity, 
  and which Resources are involved in the Defect. Dates are used to track when 
  the Defect was Opened, Evaluated, and Closed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Defect #</B></span> is generated by Project 
    InVision and is not editable. It is one way to identify the defect.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Defect Title</B></span> is a brief (up to 40 
    characters) description of the defect.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Description</B></span> can contain as much 
    text as necessary; enter and add details as the defect progresses through 
    the workflow.</li>

    description of what caused the defect.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Resolution</B></span> can contain as much text 
    as necessary to document the defect resolution.</li>
  <li><a href="About_Workflows.htm"><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Workflow</B></span></a> defines the order in which the 
    Status of a particular record may be changed in Project InVision. Each time 
    the Status of a Project InVision record is changed, Project InVision logs 
    the date, time, and User responsible for the change. Click the Status label 
    to see Status History.<span class=note><br>
    The Workgroup Administrator defines the Workflows that are available for each 
    individual Workgroup. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Status</B></span> defines steps within a workflow.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Status Revised</B></span> is an uneditable 
    filed that shows who updated the defect to the current status and when.</li>
  <li><b>Type</b> is the type of the Defect, used to categorize and search for 
    Defect records.</li>
  <li><b>Priority</b> is the priority of the Defect, used to categorize and search 
    for Defect records.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Responsible</B></span> is the Resource who 
    is currently responsible for the defect at this status in the workflow.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Task Name</B></span> is the task that the defect 
    is associated with. If a Defect is associated with a specific Task, then the 
    Defect is displayed in the Time Tracking application so that time can be posted 
    against the Defect and rolled up into the Project Task. See <a href="About_Time_Tracking.htm">Time 
    Tracking</a>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Discovery Date </B></span>is the date that 
    the defect was first found (which may be before it was actually entered into 
    Project InVision.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Evaluation Date </B></span>is the date the 
    defect was evaluated (for impact, resource use, and planning).</li>

    defect was actually resolved.</li>
