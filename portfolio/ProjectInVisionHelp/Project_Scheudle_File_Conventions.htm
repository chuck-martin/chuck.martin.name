<h1> Project Schedule File Conventions</h1>
 
<p>A number of conventions must be followed to ensure that the project schedule 
  file and the Project InVision information stays in sync. Actions performed in 
  your project management application may break the links with associated records 
  in Project InVision if these conventions are not followed. Anything that affects 
  the Unique Task ID in your project management application adversely affects 
  the corresponding record linked to that ID in Project InVision.</p>
<h2>Conventions</h2>
<h3>Checking In a Project Schedule File For the First Time</h3>
<p>Define the Project team by <a href="Assigning_Resources_to_Projects.htm">assigning 
  Resources to the Project</a> before the file is checked in. The Resource Sheet 
  of the Project file is updated once it is checked in.</p>
<p class=note>If the Resources existing in the Project file do not match the Resources 
  in the Project InVision Project record, an Unmatched Resources alert is received 
  and the you must manually reconcile the Resources. You must either update the 
  Resource name in the Resource Sheet of the project schedule file so it matches 
  the Resource name in the Project InVision Project record, add the unmatched 
  Resources to the Project InVision Project record if the Resource does not exist, 
  or delete the unmatched Resources from the project schedule file.</p>
<h3>Applying Work Hours to the Project File</h3>
<p>Apply Actual Work Hours using the <a href="About_Time_Tracking.htm">Time Tracking</a> 
  module of Project InVision. The hours are then synchronized with the project schedule file. </p>
<h3>Checking In/Checking Out Project Schedule Files</h3>
<p>Always <a href="Checking_In_Project_Schedule_Files.htm">check in</a> the same 
  project schedule file that you checked out.</p>
<p class="note">Because of the way files are transferred over the Web, spaces 
  in the filename are replaced with the characters &#8220;%20&#8221; during check 
  out. If you save the file as-is, those characters will remain in the filename 
  and you'll have two similarly named files. To resolve this, review the File 
  name field and replace any instances of %20 with a space by selecting the &#8220;%20&#8221; 
  characters and pressing the spacebar.</p>
<p>Create individual Projects as sub-Projects of a parent and track time against 
  the sub-Projects. Information regarding the roll up of sub-Projects can be processed 
  using Hierarchies and Group by selections.</p>
<p>Remove any active custom views or restrictive filters from the project schedule file that have been saved in Gantt chart view before checking the file in.</p>
<h3>Timing for Checking In Project Schedule Files</h3>
<p>Wait to check out project schedule files until after timesheets have been 
  submitted for the previous week. This ensures that the schedules are up to date 
  with the most current data. </p>
<h3>Adding a new Task to a Project Schedule File</h3>
<p>Add the Task to the end of the Project schedule, regardless of which Tasks 
  may be predecessors or successors. Then, link the Task to its appropriate successors 
  and predecessors.</p>
<p>Insert a new Task between other Tasks to generate a new, unique Task ID. Individual 
  cell data can then be copied to the new Task.</p>
<p class=note>If you modify an existing Task with new information. Actual Work 
  Hours may already be posted to the original Task and the schedule may show erroneous 
  results.</p>
<h3>Moving an Existing Task in a Project Schedule File</h3>
<p>Select the whole Task line, click on the Task number (in the gray area), and 
  drag the Task to the new location. This keeps the original Unique ID associated 
  with the Task and simply renumbers the Task.</p>
<h3>Deleting an existing Task from a Project Management Application</h3>
<p>Ensure that the Task does not contain Resource assignments or Actual Work Hours 
  posted against it.</p>
<h3>Using Recurring Tasks in a Project Management Application</h3>
<p>Create Recurring Tasks as multiple Tasks with individual Unique ID's and Resource 
  assignments. </p>
<h3>Marking a Task as Complete, with no Hours Logged </h3>
<p>Check Out the Schedule, set the Remaining Work to zero for each Resource, then 
  mark the Task as 100% complete.</p>
<h3>Marking a Task as Complete, with Actual Work Hours posted, but Remaining Work 
  greater than zero</h3>
<p>Check Out the Schedule, set the Remaining Work to zero for each Resource, then 
  mark the Task as 100% complete.</p>
<h3>Marking a Task as Complete, with Actual Work Hours posted, and Remaining Work 
  is zero</h3>
<p>Check Out the project schedule file and change the % complete to 100%.</p>
<h3>Deleting Resources from Task Assignments</h3>
<p>Change the Remaining Work for the Resource to zero, then mark the Task as complete 
  (if applicable). Do not delete the Resource.</p>
<h2>Additional Project Management Application Notes</h2>
<h3>Copying Timesheets</h3>
<p>The Copy Timesheet feature in Time Tracking should be used with the following 
  guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tasks with 0 Remaining Hours are removed from the new week.</li>
  <li>Fixed-duration Tasks from the previous week may shift in duration if additional 
    Remaining Hours are logged.</li>
  <li>Previous week time should be submitted before new week time is submitted.</li>
  <li>Completed Tasks may have additional Actual Work Hours logged in Time Tracking 
    if the Assignment Hierarchy filter selection is set to ALL. Users will see 
    all Tasks, whether complete or not, and can log additional Actual Work Hours 
    against completed Tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assigning Resources to Tasks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When initially assigning Resources to Fixed Unit Task types in the project 
    schedule file, project management software assumes the Resource's defined 
    max unit is 1.</li>
  <li>When assigning Resources to Tasks, ensure Current Work hours are entered 
    for each Resource assigned to the Task. This will provide Resource with Remaining 
    Hours so the Task will appear in the Time Tracking application.</li>
  <li>Project InVision supports the replacement of Resource assignments between 
    Resources. When a Resource is replaced at the Project level, the replacement 
    will carry through to the project schedule file.</li>
  <li>Do not assign Resources at the Summary Task level. Summary Tasks are rollups 
    of other Tasks that have assigned Resources, but Summary Tasks should not 
    have resources assigned directly, even if the project management application 
    allows it. Such assignments to Summary Tasks cannot be synchronized.</li>
  <li>If a Resource changes the Remaining Hours in their Timesheet, it will change 
    the Remaining Work in the project schedule file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project InVision Resource Planning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Project InVision's Resource Planning feature is defined for an entire Workgroup 
    based on the Workgroup Option settings for the Workgroup calendar, under-utilized 
    threshold, or over-allocation threshold.</li>
  <li>Project InVision's Resource Planning feature uses the Workgroup Calendar 
    Work Week and the Resource's availability to determine over-allocation or 
    under-utilization. If the Workgroup Calendar and the project management program's 
    Standard Calendar do not match, then the Resource Planning feature may not 
    accurately reflect the Resource's allocation.</li>
  <li>The Resource Planning feature does not affect the Tasks in the project schedule 
    file when doing &#8220;What if?&#8221; scenarios for changing Resource allocations. 
    The project schedule file needs to be updated to reflect any desired changes 
    based on the &#8220;What if?&#8221; scenarios.</li>
  <li>The Resource Task assignment unit in the project schedule file updates Resource 
    requirements in the Resource Planning feature. </li>
</ul>
