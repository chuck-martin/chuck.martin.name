<h1>Resources Module Reports</h1>

<p>Resources module Reports contain information related to Resources and their 
  status across the Enterprise. The Reports available for the Resources module 
  are described below (with Report Options), along with a description of the Report 
  and the fields that are captured.</p>

<p class=note>Reports may be customized by the Workgroup Administrator 
 or a Report Writer, so some fields may not exist or may be labeled differently 
 than shown here.</p>

<h3>Resource List (Projects, Resources Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report is a contact list of Resources for the Workgroup or for a group 
  of Projects. Project fields: Name, Title, Department, Phone Type, Phone Number, 
  Email Type, Email Address, and Address.</p>
<h3>Resource Assignment - Overview (Projects, Resources Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report shows individual Resources, their Projects, and their Tasks, grouped 
  by Resource and then by Project. Project fields: Resource Number, First Name, 
  Last Name, Middle Initial, Project Number, Project Title, Task Number, Task 
  Name, Current Work, Units, Start Date, and Finish Date.</p>
<h3>Resource Assignment - Detail (Projects, Resources Filter)</h3>
<p>This Report shows individual Resources, their Projects, and their Tasks, grouped 
  by Resource and then by Project. Project fields: Resource Number, First Name, 
  Last Name, Middle Initial, Project Number, Project Title, Task Number, Task 
  Name, Current Work, Baseline Work, Actual Work, Start Date, and Finish Date.</p>
<h3>Resource Analysis - Overview (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects Filter, 
  Scale, Rollup, Representation, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
<p>This Report shows Resource Availability. You can see how much of a Resource's 
  time is available, how much is required, and how much is a surplus or a shortage 
  so you can see if Resources have been over-allocated to Tasks or if they are 
  available to be assigned new Tasks. The Scale can be set at Daily, Weekly, Monthly, 
  or Quarterly. Numbers can be rolled up by Entire Resource Pool, Resource, Skill 
  Category, Department, or Region and be represented as a percentage, as # of 
  Resources, or as Work Hours.</p>
<h3>Resource Analysis - Requirement (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects Filter, 
  Scale, Rollup, Representation, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
<p>This Report shows Resource requirements in terms of currently assigned Work 
  Hours of the Resource. You can see the individual and overall Work requirements 
  for the specified Date Ranges. Red indicates a shortage or over-allocation of 
  that Resource (more Required Hours than the Resource can accomplish in the time 
  frame). The Scale can be Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly. Numbers can be 
  rolled up by Entire Resource Pool, Resource, Skill Category, Department, or 
  Region and he resulting numbers can be represented as a percentage, as # of 
  Resources, or as Work Hours.</p>
<h3>Resource Analysis - Surplus / Shortage (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects 
  Filter, Scale, Rollup, Representation, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
<p>This Report shows Resource availability in terms of Work Hours available for 
  Task assignments. You can see how much of a Resource's time is available. Red 
  indicates a shortage or over-allocation of that Resource. The Scale can be set 
  at Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly. Numbers can be rolled up by Entire 
  Resource Pool, Resource, Skill Category, Department, or Region and then be represented 
  as a percentage, as # of Resources, or as work hours.</p>
<h3>Resource Analysis - Detailed (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects Filter, 
  Scale, Rollup, Representation, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
<p>This Report shows Resource Requirements on a Project-by-Project basis. The 
  Scale can be set at Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly. Numbers can then be 
  rolled up by Entire Resource Pool, Resource, Skill Category, Department, or 
  Region and represented as a percentage, as # of Resources, or as Work Hours. 
  The Report is especially useful to review the availability of a particular Skill 
  Category or individual Resource. If Filters are applied based on a Skill Category, 
  but displayed by Resource, you can see the Resources belonging to the Skill 
  Category available for assignment to Projects within the selected time.</p>
<h3>Resource Curve Chart (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects Filter, Scale, 
  Content, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
<p>This Report shows a line chart of Actual Work or Actual Cost over time.</p>
<h3>Resource Histogram (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects Filter, Scale, Rollup, 
  Representation, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
<p>This Report shows a bar chart of Resource availability. Availability is yellow, 
  Allocation is blue, and Over-Allocation is red. The Scale can be set at Daily, 
  Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly. Numbers can then be rolled up by Entire Resource 
  Pool, Resource, Skill Category, Department, or Region. The resulting numbers 
  can then be represented as a percentage, as # of Resources, or Work Hours.</p>
<h3>Resource Project Calendar (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects Filter, Scale, 
  Rollup, Representation, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
<p>This Report shows Resource availability on a Project by Project basis. The 
  Scale can be set at Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly. Numbers can be rolled 
  up by Entire Resource Pool, Resource, Skill Category, Department, or Region 
  and then represented as a percentage, as # of Resources, or as Work hours. The 
  data are displayed both in a table and in an Availability Graph, which shows 
  white for Available and blue for Allocated.</p>
<h3>Resource Utilization Chart (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects Filter, Scale, 
  Rollup, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
<p>This Report shows Resource availability on a timescale basis. The Scale can 
  be set at Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly. Numbers can be rolled up by 
  Entire Resource Pool, Resource, Skill Category, Department, or Region. The data 
  is shown graphically as colors: teal for Underutilized, yellow for Even Allocation, 
  and red for Overallocated. </p>
<h3>Billing Actual Work by Billing Code (Projects, Resources Filter, Projects 
  Filter, Date Range, From Date, To Date)</h3>
