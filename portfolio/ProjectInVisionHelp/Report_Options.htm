<h1> Report Options</h1>

<p>Reports options refine the information that will be contained in the report.</p>

<h2>Report Option Details</h2>
<p>The options you can choose from depend on the report selected, so not all options 
  listed here may appear.</p>
<h3>Workgroups </h3>
<p>Select an individual Workgroup, All Workgroups, All My Workgroups, Workgroup 
  groupings, or specific Workgroups containing data to be displayed in the Report.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>-Current-</b> &#8212; Generates the report for the current Workgroup 
    only.</li>
  <li><img src="images/All_Workgroups_icon.gif" width="13" height="12">&nbsp;<b>-All 
    Workgroups-</b> &#8212; Generates the Report for all Workgroups, regardless 
    of whether or not you are a member of all Workgroups. You must belong to a 
    User Category that allows reporting across all Workgroups.</li>
  <li><img src="images/All_Workgroups_icon.gif" width="13" height="12">&nbsp;<b>-All 
    My Workgroups-</b> &#8212; Generates the report for all Workgroups where you're 
    a member.</li>
  <li><img src="images/Workgroup_Grouping_icon.gif" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;<b>Workgroup 
    Groupings</b> &#8212; Generates the report for a Workgroup Grouping, which 
    is a named group of multiple Workgroups defined by the Workgroup Administrator. 
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Projects </h3>
<p>Select a Project or a group of Projects to see a report of information only 
  from that Project or that group of Projects. To select a group of projects, 
  click on the <b>Find</b> button, then in the Find dialog box, click the <b>Selector</b> 
  link, select the check box for a group of Projects, then click <b>Select</b>.</p>
<h3>Filter </h3>
<p>Select a pre-determined Filter for the data being used for the Report. The 
  filter options are specific to the module and you may have more than one filter 
  available. </p>
<h3>Group By </h3>
<p>Select an option to group data by specific field. This option is dependent 
  on the module from which the Report is selected. For example, for Projects, 
  the groups available might be by Type, Status, Region, Department, or other 
  such field on the Information page of the <a href="Projects_Detail_Form.htm">Projects 
  Detail Form</a>.</p>
<h3>Scale </h3>
<p>Select a scale that determines how the data will be displayed. The choices 
  you have will depend on the report and can include Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and 
  Quarterly.</p>
<h3>Content </h3>
<p>Select the type of data to be viewed. This is dependent on the module and the 
  specifics of the data to be presented. For example, for the Resources Actual 
  Work Pie Report, the Content would be Actual Work and Actual Cost, but for the 
  Resource Work Pie Chart, the Content would change to Current Work, Baseline 
  Work, Current Cost, and Baseline Cost.</p>
<h3>Representation </h3>
<p>Select how data will be represented in a report. This is dependent on the module 
  and the specifics of the data to be presented. For example, for the Resources 
  Project Calendar Report, the Representation would be a Percentage, the Number 
  of Resources, or Work Hours.</p>
<h3>Group </h3>
<p>Select how data will be grouped in a Report. This is dependent on the module 
  from which the Report is selected and the specifics of the data to be presented. 
  For example, for the Resources Actual Work Pie Report, the Group would be Project, 
  Type, Priority, Status, Condition, Region, or Department.</p>
<h3>Date Range </h3>
<p>Select a range of dates based on recognized organizational groupings. Generally, 
  these groupings are as follows: Current Year, Last Year, Next Year, Current 
  Quarter, Last Quarter, Next Quarter, Current Month, Last Month, Next Month, 
  Current Week, Last Week, and Next Week.</p>
<h3>From </h3>
<p>If no specific Date Range is chosen, select a starting point for the Report 
  being printed. All records with dates prior to this date will be excluded from 
  the Report. If a Date Range is specified, the From date will default to a value 
  consistent with a Date Range chosen (i.e., If Current Year is chosen, the From 
  date will be January 1st of that year).</p>
<h3>To </h3>
<p>If no specific Date Range is chosen, select an ending point for the Report 
  being printed. All records with dates after this date will be excluded from 
  the Report. If a Date Range is specified, the To date will default to a value 
  consistent with a Date Range chosen (i.e., If Current Year is chosen, the To 
  date will be December 31st of that year). </p>
