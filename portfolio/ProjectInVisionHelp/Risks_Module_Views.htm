<h2>Risks Module Views</h2>

<p>Default <a href="About_Views.htm">Views</a> have been created for the 
 Risks module. Your security access determines what Views you can see.</p>

 or a Report Writer, so some View names or fields may not exist or may 
 be labeled differently than shown here.</p>

<h3>-Standard-</h3>

<p>This View shows current status information for selected Project Tasks: 
 the individual Tasks, the Current Finish date of the Task, and the % of 
 the Task that is complete. You can view and edit information related to 
 Actual and Baseline Dates, as well as comments and Resource information. 
 Fields: Project Number, Project Title, Task Name, Task Number, Current 
 Finish, % Complete, Resource Initials, Actual Start, Actual Finish, Base 
 Start, Base Finish, Current Start, Comments, Task Code, and Resource Name.</p>

<h3>Detail</h3>

<p>This View shows detailed information about Risks that exist for selected 
 Projects, grouped by Project. You can see information related to the Risk, 
 as well as who is responsible for it, when it was evaluated, and the current 
 status of the Risk. Fields: Project Number, Project Title, Risk Number, 
 Risk Title, Responsible, Submitted by, Date Entered, Evaluation Date, 
 Date Closed, Status, Probability, Magnitude, Type, Priority, Description, 
 Mitigation Plan, and Impact.</p>

<h3>Risk Actual Work Pie</h3>

<p>This View is a Pie Chart with slices based on Rollup selection and the 
 Date Range specified. Depending on the Rollup used, the Work Hours will 
 display for the specified Date Range, grouped by Rollup. Numbers can be 
 rolled up by Type, Priority, Probability, Magnitude, Status, Responsible, 
 Submitted by, or Project. Fields: Risk Number, Risk Title, Status, Actual 
 Work, and Timesheet Date.</p>

<h3>Risk Count Chart </h3>

<p>This View shows a total count of Risks separated into groups by <a href="View_Options.htm#Rollup">Rollup</a>. 
 Numbers can be rolled up by Type, Priority, Probability, Magnitude, Status, 
 Responsible, Submitted by, or Project.</p>

<h3>Risk Count Pie</h3>

<p>ThisView is a pie chart with slices based on <a href="View_Options.htm#Rollup">Rollup</a> 
 selection. Depending on the rollup used, the counts will display grouped

 rolled up by Type, Priority, Probability, Magnitude, Status, Responsible, 
 Submitted by, or Project. Fields: Risk Number, Risk Title, Status, and 
 Count.</p>

<h3>Risk Personal Count Chart </h3>

 Responsible party. Numbers can be rolled up by Type, Priority, Probability, 
 Magnitude, Status, Responsible, Submitted by, or Project. </p>

<h3>Risk Priority Matrix</h3>

<p>This View shows a matrix that compares Risk Magnitude to Risk Priority. 
 It separates the counts into High, Medium, and Low magnitude versus High, 
 Medium, and Low Priorities.</p>

<h3>Risk Probability Matrix</h3>

<p>This View shows a matrix that compares Risk Probability to Risk Magnitude. 
 It separates the counts into High, Medium, and Low Probability versus 
 High, Medium, and Low Magnitude.</p>
