<h1>Advanced Filters</h1>

<p>Advanced filters allow you to apply multiple criteria against records to get 
  specific information results. Security profiles determine your ability to create 
  and edit filters.</p>

<p>To apply a filter without specifying multiple criteria, you can apply a <a href="Quick_Filters.htm">Quick 
  Filter</a> on any field in the current View.</p>

<h4>To create an advanced filter</h4>

<ol>
  <li>In the Navigation menu, click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Filter</B></span> 
    (not the down arrow next to the word). The Filters dialog box appears.</li>
  <li>Click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>New Filter</B></span>.<br>
    If you want to extend an existing filter, select it from the <b>Based on</b> 
    drop-down list.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Name</b> field, enter a name of up to 25 characters.</li>
  <li>Enter the details for one or more criteria: </li>
  <ol type="a" class="whs1">
    <li>In <b>List Name</b>, select the list that contains the field to be used 
      in the filter.<br>
      Complex Filters may be based on a maximum of two lists per Filter. One of 
      the two lists must be the current list.</li>
    <li>In <b>Field Name</b>, select a field. The choices you see are based on 
      the selection in List Name.</li>
    <li>In <b>Test</b>, select an operator. You can choose from:<br>
      <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1">
        <tr> 
          <td width="130" class="smallfont"><b>&lt;</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Less than the entered value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont"><b>&lt;=</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Less than or equal to the entered value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont"><b>=</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Equal to the entered value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>&gt;</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Greater than the entered value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>&gt;=</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Greater than or equal to the entered value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Not</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Not the entered value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Starts With</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Starts with the entered text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Contains</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Contains the entered text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Ends With</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Ends with the entered text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Doesn't Start With</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Does not start with the entered text</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Doesn't Contain</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Does not contain the entered text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Doesn't End With</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Does not end with the entered text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Sounds Like</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Close phonetically. (For example, &#8220;Smith&#8221; 
            would find &#8220;Smythe&#8221; and perhaps others.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Is Null</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Contains nothing (is blank).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="smallfont" ><b>Is Not Null</b></td>
          <td class="smallfont" >Contains something (is not blank).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
    <li>In <b>Value</b>, enter or select a qualifier. Click in the field and type 
      in a value, or click in the field and then click the ellipsis button to 
      select from the Select Values dialog box. The choices you see are based 
      on the selection in Field Name.<br>
      You can have multiple items in the Value field by typing values, separated 
      by semicolons, or by selecting multiple values in the Select Values dialog 
      box.<br>
      Custom Fields may also be selected by choosing the &#8220;ModuleName Custom&#8221; 
      item (i.e., Projects Custom, Resources Custom, etc.). Calculated Fields 
      may also be selected by choosing the &#8220;ModuleName Calculated&#8221; 
      item (i.e. Projects Calculated, Resources Calculated, etc.).</li>
    <li>To use multiple criteria, click to select the appropriate <b>And/Or</b> 
      operator.<br>
      The And operator creates conditions where both the first condition and the 
      second condition must be met. The Or operator creates more inclusive conditions 
      because either the first condition or the second condition can be met.<br>
      Click on the bottom row to add a row below, or click on a row and then click 
      Insert Filter Row to add a row directly above. Then repeat steps a through 
      d for each Filter criteria.</li>
    <li>If you define multiple criteria, you can click on the <b>Parenthesis</b> 
      field on the end of either row to create additional logic in the Filter. 
      The parentheses in a Filter serve the same purpose as they would in a mathematical 
      equation. Elements in parentheses are evaluated first.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>In the <b>Sort By</b> list, select a Field Name to sort by, then double 
    click on the <b>Asc/Desc</b> field to select ascending or descending order. 
    Select a Field Name in the bottom row to add additional rows of sort criteria.</li>
  <li>Click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Submit</B></span>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Filter Functions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Current User() - This will filter a list for the Current User logged into 
    the Project InVision system. This Filter criterion is usable only for a Resource 
    field in any list. One example of this Filter is where a Filter is needed 
    at the Projects module level to show &#8220;My Projects.&#8221; Instead of 
    creating a &#8220;My Projects&#8221; Filter for every single User Login, only 
    one Filter needs to be created where &#8220;Manager = CurrentUser()&#8221; 
    and each time the Filter is applied, it looks to the current logged-in user 
    and runs a Filter for that person where the Manager field is equal to the 
    Current User's Resource ID.</li>
  <li>ResRollupTo(ResourceName) - This rolls up the criteria to the selected Resource 
    Name. This Filter criterion is currently usable only on the Manager field 
    in the Resources module. This Filter would be used when you want to filter 
    all of the resource records to display only those resources whose Manager 
    = a specified Resource.</li>
  <li>Current Date(FieldName) - This filters a list for the Current Date. This 
    Filter criterion is usable only on Date fields. One example of this Filter 
    is when a Filter is needed to show all tasks that are due to start today. 
    A Filter would be created at the Tasks module level where Current Start = 
    Current Date (The current date used will be the machine date of the workstation).</li>
  <li>Field(FieldName) - This filters a list for the specified field name. This 
    Filter criterion is usable only for a Resource field in any list. One example 
    is a Filter to show all Projects where you are both the Manager and the Sponsor 
    of a Project record. A Filter would be created where Manager = Field(Sponsor).</li>
  <li>ProjRollupTo(ProjectNumber) - This rolls up the criteria to the selected 
    Project Number. This Filter criterion is usable only for a Projects list. 
    This Filter can be used to filter a Projects list to show only the Projects 
    for a specified parent Project. A Filter would be created where Parent Project 
    = ProjRollupTo(Project Number).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes on Filters</h2>

<h3>Modules</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Filters may be based on a maximum of two Modules per Filter. One of the 
    two Modules MUST be the current Module. Custom fields may also be selected 
    by choosing the &#8220;ModuleName- Custom&#8221; item (i.e., Projects Custom, 
    Resources Custom, etc.).</li>
  <li>&#8220;ModuleName Custom&#8221; entries will appear only if Custom Fields 
    have been defined for the module in the specific Workgroup in which the Filter 
    is being created.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Field Names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Field Names appear based on the module that is chosen. If a standard module 
    is chosen, then all standard fields for that module are displayed in the Field 
    Names pull-down. If a Custom Module is chosen (i.e., Resources Custom), then 
    only the Custom Fields for that module appear in the Field Names pull-down.</li>
  <li>If no Custom Fields have been created for a particular module, then the 
    &#8220;ModuleName Custom&#8221; entry does not appear in the Module pull-down.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test</h3>

<p>The Tests are expressions that are run against the data to see if they 
 meet a specific value. The expression is always created in terms of Field, 
 Test, and Value (i.e., Project Number = 10). If the expression is true, 
 then the data is presented.</p>

<h3>Values</h3>

<p>The Value can be typed directly into the Value 
 field of the Filters dialog box, unless an ellipsis appears. If an ellipsis 
 appears, you must click on the ellipsis to open the Values List dialog 
 box. </p>
