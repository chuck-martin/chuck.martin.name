<h1>About Resource Costing</h1>

<p>As Resources are assigned to work on Tasks, Project costs are calculated and 
  maintained in Project InVision by multiplying the work hours for the Resource 
  assignments by the hourly cost rate for the resource. </p>
<p> Resource cost rates are maintained in Project InVision in two ways: by Resource 
  or by Skill Category. Cost rates are stored by Resource in the Internal Rate 
  and Billing Rate fields on the Information page of the <a href="Resources_Detail_Form.htm">Resource 
  Detail form</a>. Cost rates by Skill Category must be maintained by the Workgroup 
  Administrator and are associated with the Resource when a Skill Category is 
  defined for the Resource on the Information page of the Resource Detail Form. 
</p>

<p>On each Project record, you can determine the source of the cost rates that 
  are used for Project cost calculations by setting the following Resource Cost 
  Rate Source and Resource Billing Rate Source options on the Options page of 
  the Project Detail form:</p>

<ul>
	
	
  <li>None - The Resource Billing and Cost Rate Source come from the project schedule 
    file and not from Project InVision.</li>
	
	<li>Resource - The Resource Billing and Cost Rate Source 
 come from the Billing Rate or Internal Rate identified in a Resource's 
 record.</li>
	
	<li>Skill Category - The Resource Billing and Cost Rate 
 Source come from Rates identified for the various Skill Categories created 
 by the Workgroup Administrator.</li>
	
	<li>Resource / Skill Category - The Resource Billing 
 and Cost Rate Source come from the Resource record. If that record is 
 blank, then the information defaults from the rates identified by Skill 
 Category.</li>
	
	<li>Skill Category / Resource - The Resource Billing 
 and Cost Rate Source come from the rates identified by Skill Category. 
 If this information is blank, then the rates default from the Resource 
 record.</li>
</ul>

<p>Project costs may be tracked on the Costing and Billing pages of the Project 
  Detail form. The Costing page is used to track the internal cost of the project, 
  while the Billing page provides a method to track customer billing or charge 
  back. Both the Costing and Billing pages track three separate categories of 
  costs: Resource, Material and Expense. Resource costs can be entered manually 
  or can be calculated based on the Current, Baseline and Actual work hours of 
  Resource assignments, multiplied by the hourly rate for Resources. Material 
  and Expense costs are always entered manually for Projects and rolled up into 
  total project costs.</p>
<p> For more information on calculating and maintaining project costs in Project 
  InVision, see <a href="Managing_Project_Costs.htm">Managing Project Costs</a>.
