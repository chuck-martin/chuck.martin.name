It is conditionally available depending on how tenant, role, or other settings are configured for your company. You may or may not be able to see or use this depending on those settings.\" />   <entry name=\"Feature Priority\" value=\"Defines the priority of policies within a feature, and determines which policies take precedence when multiple features are active on a device and an event occurs that matches more than one policy. The highest-priority (lowest-numbered) policy that matches takes priority when this happens and its policy event is enforced. Lower-priority policies are ignored for that event.\" />   <entry name=\"First Subscriber\" value=\"First subscriber is a concept used when multiple subscribers are allowed in an account and there are multiple subscribers in an account. In certain cases, a first subscriber must be determined, for example, when an exclusive product is received as a benefit.      The first subscriber in an account is the subscriber with the earliest current join date.      Note that if a subscriber joins, unjoins, and then joins again, the most recent join date is used for this determination, not the original join date.\" />   <entry name=\"HNI\" value=\"Home network identifier.

If software includes the correct locale content, then a device can display the content for the locate set for it. For example, you might have a string &quot;The color is red.&quot; defined for the U.S. English locale, and a string &quot;The colour is red.&quot; defined for the British English and Canadian English locales, so if a device is set to one of those locales, the content displayed would depend on which of those locales was chosen.\" />   <entry name=\"MCC\" value=\"A Mobile Country Code is a 3-digit identifier that identifies a specific country. It combines with a mobile network code (MNC) to uniquely identify a GSM/LTE (and sometimes CDMA and other networls) mobile operator.

An MEID is 56 bits long (14 hex digits). It consists of three fields, including an 8-bit (2 hex digits) regional code, a 24-bit (6 hex digits) manufacturer code, and a 24-bit (6 hex digits) manufacturer-assigned serial number.\" />   <entry name=\"Milliseconds from Epoch\" value=\"Epoch is a programming term that is often used for another programming term: UNIX time (also POSIX time and UNIX timestamp). Programmers came up with the idea of setting an arbitrary fixed time and date from which to calculate any other time and date, which makes time-and-date calculations easier in code. The epoch allows you to &quot;easily&quot; calculate the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight, January 1, 1970, UTC. (there is an ISO standard format for expressing times and dates, ISO 8601, and this time and date in ISO 8602 format is 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.)  &quot;Easily&quot; is relative. Let's say you have two dates and times: 04:38:17 on July 17, 2017 and 17:12:04 on September 28, 2017. How much time is between them? Because computer systems use the epoch as a reference point, programmers calculate the time from epoch for both, and then use those numbers in their code. In this case, the first time and date is 1500266297 seconds from epoch and the second time and date is 1506618724 from epoch. Subtract the smaller number from the larger (easy) and you have 6352427 seconds. Divide by 60 and you have 105873 minutes and 47 seconds. Divide the number of minutes by 60 and you have 1764 hours and 33 minutes. Divide 1764 by 24 and you have 73.5 days. .5 is 12 hours, so there is 73 days, 12 hours, 33 minutes, and 47 seconds between the two times and dates.    There are many, many converters available to covert and specific time and date to epoch. For example, one that comes up in a Google search in EpochConverter. You can enter any date and time, for example 12:15:00 GMT on July 1, 2017, and it will calculate a result of 1498911300. This number is actually the number of seconds from the epoch to the entered date and time, but this calculator also gives you the number of milliseconds (which you get by just adding 3 zeroes at the end): 1498911300000.\" />   <entry name=\"MIN\" value=\"A unique 24-bit number assigned by a carrier to each phone it sells or includes in service plans.      Unlike an Electronic Serial Number (ESN), a MIN is changeable because wireless phones may change hands or phone owners may move to another coverage region, requiring a different service plan.      The MIN and ESN are both automatically transmitted to the wireless network each time the phone is used to verify that the phone has not been reported lost or stolen and that all subscriber bills are current.\" />   <entry name=\"MNC\" value=\"A Mobile Network Code is a 2- or 3-digit code that uniquely identifies a carrier in a country. A carrier may have more than one MNC in a country.\" />   <entry name=\"MRC\" value=\"MRC stands for Monthly Recurring Cost and its basic meaning is the total of the monthly costs of all recurring subscriptions with cycle durations of 1 month. The calculation of MRC includes active, suspended, and consumed subscriptions, but not pending subscriptions.      The calculation of MRC can be tenant-specific. The default calculation takes into account monthly subscriptions that are account aligned. For a tenant that does not have account-aligned plans, the calculation could include monthly base plans (plans purchased through exchange categories) plus any other recurring monthly plans. A tenant's calculation may also include monthly recurring fees in the MRC calculation.      MRC is also referred to as &quot;monthly aligned recurring cost&quot; and &quot;monthly cost.&quot;\" />   <entry name=\"Native Notification\" value=\"Native notifications are delivered using the mobile operating system's (Android or iOS) notification service. These notificaitons can appear on a device in different ways, depending on the operating system's capability and the device user's settings.    These type of notifcations can appear in a popup window, as a slide-down banner, or sometimes in other forms, including on a device's lock screen. These different presentations may offer different types of interactivity. For example, a popup window will have a button that a user can top to dismiss the notificaiton, and may allow other buttons.\" />   <entry name=\"NID\" value=\"A Network Identification Number is a 16-bit numeric identifier used by CDMA cellular systems to identify the network within the home system of a wireless carrier and by a CDMA mobile device to recognize the type of system it is accessing and to determine its roaming status\" />   <entry name=\"provision\" value=\"Provisioning is the process of adding a subscriber (line of service) to the ItsOn system. There are two types of provisioning, depending on the carrier interface.        Push provisioning: The carrier system contacts the ItsOn system to add a subscriber and provides data about that subscriber.      Pull provisioning: When a SIM that is not yet in the ItsOn system attempts to use ItsOn services, the ItsOn system contacts the carrier, and if the carrier approves, the subscriber is added.\" />   <entry name=\"SHOE\" value=\"\" />   <entry name=\"SID\" value=\"A System Identification Number is a 15-bit numeric identifier used by CDMA cellular systems to identify the home system of a wireless carrier and by a CDMA mobile device to recognize the type of system it is accessing and to determine its roaming status.
