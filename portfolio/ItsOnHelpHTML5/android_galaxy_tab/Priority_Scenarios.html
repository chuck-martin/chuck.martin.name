  <h1>Priority Scenarios</h1>
  <p>Understanding how the priority setting in network features and eCommerce 
 policies directs the ItsOn software to use the correct policy when devices 
 interact with your network is important for selecting the right priority 
 in the <a hqid="232050" href="#">network feature</a> and <a hqid="1789991" 
															 href="#">eCommerce 
 policy</a> properties. This topic explains why network features and eCommerce 
 policies have priorities and provides some <a hqid="232049" href="#SampleScenarios">scenarios 
 showing how priorities work</a>.</p>
  <p>One very important reason for priorities is for conflict resolution. 
 Because usage can be attributed to one and only one policy, if a customer 
 uses a service that matches more than one policy or feature, the use is 
 attributed to the correct one based on priority settings.</p>
  <div class="tip">
	If a device has a choice of plans based on eCommerce policies with 
	 the same priority, the plan purchased first will be the one used first.
  </div>
  <p>To demonstrate how priorities work, you must first establish an ordered 
 list of priorities. That list could vary depending on a carrier's needs, 
 but the following list and order is used for the examples in this topic:</p>
  <ol>
	<li><span>Carrier</span></li>
	<li><span>Network Protection</span></li>
	<li><span>Parental Control</span></li>
	<li><span>Sponsored</span></li>
	<li><span>Paid Application</span></li>
	<li><span>Paid (Default)</span></li>
	<li>Carrier Backstop</li>
</ol>
<p>The important thing to understand is that the order of the list determines 
 the priority. The higher on the list, the higher the priority. The names 
 you use do not define priority, but you should use names that help you 
 remember the priority order. Numbers are added as an aid (the lower the 
 number, the higher the priority).</p>
<h2><a name="SampleScenarios" id="SampleScenarios"></a>Sample Scenarios</h2>
<p>These scenarios illustrate how you use priorities to manage real world 
 use cases and use the example priority list shown above.</p>
<h3 id="FeaturePriorityScenarios-Paid(Default)vs.PaidApplication">(6) Paid 
 (Default) vs. (5) Paid Application</h3>
<p>A customer has a 100MB data plan. The plan is based on a policy with 
 (6) Paid (Default) priority. The customer has also purchased a Facebook 
 plan, which is based on a policy with (5) Paid Application priority. If 
 the customer then uses Facebook, that use would not be charged against 
 their 100MB data plan because the Facebook plan uses a higher-priority 
 policy. &#160;On the other hand, if the Facebook priority was configured 
 lower than (6) Paid (Default), the 100MB plan would be consumed for Facebook 
 usage, which is probably not the intention.</p>
<h3 id="FeaturePriorityScenarios-PlanBundles">Plan Bundles</h3>
<p>You may offer plans in a bundle where some types of usage could match 
 one of several plans in the bundle. However, usage can be attributed to 
 one and only one policy. Policy priority determines which plan is used 
 first. For example, you have a plan bundle that includes a 100-minute 
 voice plan that includes international calling and a 10-minute international 
 calling plan. The international calling plan is based on a policy with 
 a higher priority than the 100-minute voice plan, so a user's international 
 calling would consume the minutes from the international calling plan 
 first. Usage from the 100-minute voice plan for international calling 
 would not begin until the international calling plan was depleted.</p>
<h3>Sponsored Plans</h3>
<p>In your list of priorities, you've defined one, (5) Paid Application, 
 that you use for the plans your customers purchase. You also allow sponsored 
 products in your store. That is, products that are paid for by sponsors, 
 not your customers. You give service eCommerce policies used for sponsored 
 products a priority of (4) Sponsored. Let's say that there's a major sporting 
 event in Arizona, and a major athletic apparel company wants to sponsor 
 data service for all your customers so they can tweet about the event, 
 post updates to Facebook, photos to Instagram, and so on. You create an 
 eCommerce policy that allows data access when social media apps are used 
 within that geographical area and give that feature (4) Sponsored priority. 
 You make the product that uses that policy available for only a specific 
 time period around the event. Now, your customers can get this product 
 for free from your store, and when they are attending the event and posting 
 updates to Facebook, the priority means that the data usage will come 
 from the sponsored plan and not their purchased data plan.</p>
<h3>Carrier Priority</h3>
<p>You don't want your customers usage to be attributed to their purchased 
 data plans when they visit your website to pay their bills or to shop 
 for more plans. So you create a network feature with a filter that defines 
 your URL and allows access, and you give that feature (1) Carrier priority. 
 When your customers then access your website from their devices, the usage 
 never gets charged to any plans that they have purchased.</p>
<h3>Necessary Connections</h3>
<p>Necessary connections are when you need to allow devices to make connections 
 when they don't have existing plans that specifically allow them. For 
 example, for diagnostic reasons, devices might need to send data to the 
 ItsOn servers. You would create a network feature that allows those specific 
 connections and give it the lowest priority, (7) Carrier Backstop in our 
 example list, so if there are no other plans that the usage can be attributed 
 to, the usage will still be permitted.</p>
